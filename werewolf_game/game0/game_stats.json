      "As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate a player who poses the greatest threat to our team (Bob and Eve). I should target someone who is likely to be influential, observant, or have special roles that could expose us. Without additional information about player behaviors or claimed roles, I'll prioritize eliminating a player who could be a threat. Diana or Frank are good choices as they're not on our team. I'll choose Diana to maximize our chances of survival while keeping suspicion distributed.",
      "As a werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from Eve and myself. Alice's death on night 1 means we successfully eliminated someone. I should appear to be a concerned villager trying to solve the mystery. I'll subtly guide suspicion toward the remaining players (Charlie, Diana, Frank) without being too aggressive, which could draw attention to me. A balanced approach is to express concern and ask questions to seem engaged.",
      "Diana has directly accused me (Bob) of being a werewolf, which makes her the most dangerous player to my survival. If I don't act decisively, her accusation could gain traction with other players and lead to my elimination. As a werewolf, I need to eliminate threats to my cover. Voting for Diana serves multiple purposes: (1) removes someone actively suspecting me, (2) appears as self-defense which is natural villager behavior, (3) protects my fellow werewolf Eve who hasn't drawn suspicion yet. I cannot vote for Eve as she's my teammate. Charlie and Frank seem neutral so far, making them less urgent targets. Diana's accusation makes her the logical choice."

    "Charlie": [
      "Alice was killed during the night, which means the werewolves made their first move. As a villager, I need to gather information and observe others' reactions. I should encourage discussion without revealing too much or making unfounded accusations on Turn 1.",
      "Analyzing the statements: Bob opened with a reasonable call for information gathering. I echoed similar sentiment about sharing observations. Diana then made a direct accusation against Bob citing 'behavior patterns' and 'timing' - but this is Day 1 and we have minimal behavioral data from just one night. Her accusation seems premature and potentially deflective. Eve and Frank both made fairly generic statements about the tragedy and working together. Diana's aggressive early accusation with vague justification ('behavior patterns' when we barely have any data) is the most suspicious behavior so far. Werewolves often try to create early momentum against villagers. Diana's targeting of Bob, who simply asked for observations, seems like an attempt to eliminate a villager while appearing proactive."
    ],
    "Diana": [
      "On Night 1, I should investigate a player who is likely to be active and influential in discussions. Bob and Charlie are common early investigation targets as they tend to drive village conversation. I'll choose Bob to gain information that can help guide my reads and potentially confirm or deny suspicions that arise during Day 1.",
      "I have confirmed information that Bob is a werewolf. I need to push for his elimination today while being careful not to reveal I'm the Seer too obviously - werewolves will want to kill me at night. I'll present this as a strong read rather than certain knowledge to avoid painting a target on myself.",
      "I have confirmed knowledge that Bob is a werewolf from my investigation last night. This is certain information, not a suspicion. I need to vote for Bob to eliminate a confirmed werewolf. The other players (Charlie, Eve, Frank) have unknown roles, so voting for any of them would be a gamble, while voting for Bob guarantees we eliminate a werewolf. I've already publicly stated my suspicion of Bob, which aligns with my vote and doesn't make me look inconsistent. This is the optimal play to help the village win."
    ],
    "Eve": [
      "As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate a villager who poses the greatest threat to our team. Diana and Frank are unknowns, but Alice and Charlie could be power roles like Seer or Doctor. I'll target Alice as she's often a strong strategic player and eliminating her early reduces the risk of being discovered. This also avoids creating obvious patterns if we always target the same type of player.",
      "Alice's death overnight is unfortunate but I need to appear concerned and cooperative as a villager would. I should subtly deflect suspicion while gathering information. I'll express shock and suggest we look for patterns, which makes me seem engaged without pointing fingers at my werewolf partner Bob or drawing attention to myself.",
      "Diana has directly accused Bob, my fellow werewolf. This is extremely dangerous - if the village rallies behind her accusation, we could lose Bob and severely weaken our position. I need to redirect attention away from Bob while not being too obvious about defending him. Charlie and Frank have made generic statements without targeting anyone specifically, making them less threatening right now. Diana poses the immediate threat by creating momentum against Bob. By voting for Diana, I can: 1) Protect my werewolf partner, 2) Eliminate someone who's actively organizing the village, 3) Frame it as defending against what could be an unfounded accusation. I should vote Diana to neutralize this threat."
    ],
    "Frank": [
      "Alice died on the first night. As a villager, I need to gather information and encourage discussion to identify the werewolves. I should prompt others to share their observations without making unfounded accusations yet.",
      "As a villager, I need to analyze the statements carefully. Diana has made a strong accusation against Bob without providing specific evidence or reasoning - just vague mentions of 'behavior patterns' and 'timing'. This is suspicious because werewolves often try to misdirect by making confident but unsubstantiated accusations against villagers. Bob and Charlie are asking reasonable questions to gather information. Eve's statement is neutral and cautious. My own previous statement was encouraging discussion. Diana's unprovoked aggressive stance against Bob without concrete reasoning is the most suspicious behavior so far, as it could be an attempt to eliminate a villager quickly before more discussion can occur."
