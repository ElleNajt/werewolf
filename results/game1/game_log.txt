--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to blend in with the villagers and gain their trust. Making a statement that seems harmless and non-suspicious will help me achieve this goal.

  [Lie detector: 0.56]

Player2 acts (public): I think we should talk about the circumstances surrounding Player6's death and see if anyone noticed anything unusual last night.
  [Lie detector: -59.19]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to start gathering information about the other players without directly accusing anyone. I'll make a statement to see who reacts defensively or suspiciously.

  [Lie detector: -53.59]
