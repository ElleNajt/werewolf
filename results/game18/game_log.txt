TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Given the medium suspicion score of my initial statement, I will try to gather more information by asking a question and also analyze the high suspicion scores of Player3 and Player4. Their responses and reactions to my question could provide more insight.
Player1 acts (public): Player3 and Player4, you both seem to have similar reactions to Player2's death. Can you provide more details about your thoughts and what you think we should do next?
  [Lie detector: -68.93]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I need to deflect suspicion from myself and Player4 while maintaining innocence. I will make a statement that seems concerned and open to discussion, without revealing any information or raising suspicion.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering information and discussing possible strategies before making any accusations. Does anyone have any ideas on how to proceed with the investigation?
  [Lie detector: -67.35]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)

Player4 acts (public): I'm still trying to process what happened last night, and I think we should be careful not to jump to conclusions. Does anyone have any ideas on how to gather more information before making any accusations?
  [Lie detector: -67.17]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player3 and Player4 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and identify potential werewolves, so I will ask them to provide more information about their thoughts and actions.
Player5 acts (public): Player3 and Player4, your statements seem similar, can you provide more details about your thoughts and actions during the night? Did you notice anything unusual?
  [Lie detector: -68.58]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player3 and Player4 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. I will keep an eye on them and consider their responses carefully. Player5 has a relatively LOW suspicion score, which could indicate innocence. I will also pay attention to Player1's responses as their suspicion score is MEDIUM.
Player6 acts (public): Let's take a closer look at Player3 and Player4's responses, and see if they can provide any information to clear their names. Does anyone have any specific questions for them?
  [Lie detector: -69.42]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player3 and Player4 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. Given that they are likely to be werewolves, I will vote to eliminate one of them. Since the suspicion scores are very close, I will choose the player with the higher score. However, since Player4's score is slightly lower than Player3's, but the difference is minimal and Player4's score is still higher than the rest, I will vote for Player4.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.86]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Given the current suspicion rankings, it's best to deflect attention from myself and Player4. Voting for Player5 seems like a safe option since they have a low suspicion score and are not currently under scrutiny. This vote will also help to distribute the suspicion among the villagers.
Player3 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.04]
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Player5 has the lowest cumulative suspicion score and is likely to be a villager, Player1 and Player6 have low suspicion scores as well, so voting for them would not be beneficial. Voting for Player3 would be counterproductive as they are my fellow werewolf. Therefore, I will vote for Player1 to blend in and avoid raising suspicion.

  [Lie detector: -69.50]
Player4 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player3 and Player4 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception.

  [Lie detector: -70.78]
Player5 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player4 has a HIGH suspicion score, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. Additionally, Player4's responses seem similar to Player3's, which also has a HIGH suspicion score. Voting out Player4 will help to eliminate a potential werewolf and reduce the risk to the village.
