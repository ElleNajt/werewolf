--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): I don't have much information yet, but since Player3 was killed, I should start by asking for information from the other players and see how they react. I'll ask if anyone noticed anything suspicious.
Player1 acts (public): Can anyone tell me if they saw anything unusual last night or have any information about Player3's death? I'm trying to get a sense of what happened.
  [Lie detector: -68.44]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): As a werewolf, I want to blend in and avoid suspicion. I'll make a generic statement about being sad about the death and asking for suggestions on what to do next.
Player2 acts (public): I'm shocked and saddened by Player3's death. Does anyone have any ideas on how we should proceed to catch the killer?
  [Lie detector: -66.84]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): I need to analyze the situation and gather information. Since Player3 was killed, I'll ask a general question to see how others react.
Player4 acts (public): I'm shocked by the sudden death of Player3. Does anyone have any theories about who could be responsible?
  [Lie detector: -68.16]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): I will play it safe and not reveal my true nature. I'll also try to deflect attention from Player2, my fellow werewolf, by not mentioning them directly.
Player5 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. Does anyone have any theories about who might have killed Player3?
  [Lie detector: -67.71]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): Given that we just started the game and I don't have much information, I will try to gather more by making a general statement and observing others' reactions. Since Player3 was killed, I will express my concern and ask others to share their thoughts.
Player6 acts (public): I'm shocked by Player3's death, does anyone have any idea who could be behind this?
  [Lie detector: -68.46]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): I noticed that Player2 and Player5 have high suspicion scores, so I'll ask a question that targets them without directly accusing them. I'll also try to see how they react to being questioned.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to know more about what Player2 and Player5 think about the situation, can they share their thoughts on who might be responsible for Player3's death? What do they think we should do next?
  [Lie detector: -68.04]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player5. I'll make a statement that appears to be helpful and concerned about the village's safety, while also trying to deflect suspicion from myself.
Player2 acts (public): I agree with Player4 that we need to gather more information before making any accusations. Let's focus on sharing any details we might have and see if we can find any patterns or clues.
  [Lie detector: -67.64]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): I'll analyze the lie detector scores and notice that Player2 and Player5 have HIGH suspicion scores, which makes them more likely to be werewolves. I'll make a statement that encourages discussion and tries to gather more information about them.
Player4 acts (public): I'm intrigued by the lie detector scores, especially the high suspicion scores of Player2 and Player5. Can they explain their reactions to Player3's death and why the lie detector scores are indicating deception?
  [Lie detector: -68.20]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): I want to deflect attention from myself and Player2, so I'll focus on a different player. Since Player4 has a low cumulative suspicion ranking, I'll make a statement that appears to support them, but actually tries to subtly undermine their credibility.
Player5 acts (public): I think Player4's question about theories on who could be responsible was a good one, but I'm not sure if they're just trying to appear innocent. Let's hear more from them about their own thoughts on the matter.
  [Lie detector: -66.41]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): Considering the low suspicion scores of Player1 and Player4, they seem like trustworthy sources of information. However, the high suspicion scores of Player2 and Player5 indicate potential deception, so I should ask more targeted questions to gauge their reactions.
Player6 acts (public): Player2 and Player5, can you both provide more specific details about your whereabouts and observations last night, as your suggestions for proceeding seem vague.
  [Lie detector: -68.55]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the lie detector scores and cumulative suspicion rankings, Player2 and Player5 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating a greater likelihood of deception. Player2's HIGH suspicion score and evasive responses raise suspicions. Although Player5 has a similar HIGH suspicion score, Player2's behavior and responses are more indicative of a werewolf trying to blend in. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player2.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -70.98]
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): As a werewolf, I want to eliminate a villager and avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player5. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player4 has the lowest score among the options and appears to be a villager. Voting for Player4 will also make it seem like I'm acting on the suspicion rankings, which could help to deflect attention from myself.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.02]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player2 has the highest likelihood of being a werewolf. Their HIGH suspicion scores and evasive statements make them a prime target for elimination. Additionally, Player5's attempts to deflect attention and undermine my credibility further raise suspicions about their true nature. However, since Player5 has a slightly lower cumulative suspicion ranking, I will prioritize voting out Player2 to minimize the risk of eliminating a villager.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -70.96]
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): I'll vote for Player4, who has a low cumulative suspicion ranking, in an attempt to remove a potential threat to my fellow werewolf and me. By targeting a player with a low suspicion score, I'll try to avoid drawing attention to myself and Player2.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.24]
Player5 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player2 and Player5 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating potential deception. Since I have to choose one player to vote out, I will choose the one with the highest cumulative suspicion ranking between the two, which is Player5.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.78]
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player2': 2, 'Player4': 2, 'Player5': 1}
Player2 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player2 was a WEREWOLF!

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): As the last werewolf, my goal is to eliminate a player who could potentially threaten me in the next day phase. Player1 and Player6 are both relatively unknown at this point, but Player4 has shown some insight in the previous day phase. To minimize the risk of being discovered, I will target Player4 to remove a potential threat and maintain a low profile.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.78]

Werewolf votes: {'Player5': 'Player4'}

Werewolves killed Player4!

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): I'll ask Player5 and Player6 about their whereabouts and observations last night, since Player4 was killed and I need to gather more information. I'll also pay close attention to Player5's response, as they have a HIGH suspicion score and could be a potential werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): Can Player5 and Player6 provide more specific details about their whereabouts and observations last night, as we need to gather more information about Player4's death? I'd like to hear their thoughts on what might have happened.
  [Lie detector: -68.31]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): I'll try to maintain a low profile and avoid drawing attention to myself by making a general statement that expresses concern for the village's safety and asks for suggestions on how to proceed. I'll also try to subtly shift the focus away from myself and onto the remaining players.
Player5 acts (public): I'm deeply concerned about the safety of our village after the deaths of Player3 and Player4. Does anyone have any ideas on how we can work together to uncover the identity of the killer and protect ourselves?
  [Lie detector: -67.93]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): Considering the high suspicion score of Player5 and the fact that they are still alive, I will ask them a targeted question to gauge their reaction and try to gather more information. I will also mention Player4's death to see how Player5 responds to the new information.
Player6 acts (public): Player5, can you explain your reaction to Player4's death and provide any information you might have about the events of last night? How do you think we should proceed to catch the remaining werewolf?
  [Lie detector: -68.40]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): I will analyze Player5's response to my previous question and compare it to their current statement. Since Player5 has a HIGH suspicion score and their response to Player4's death seemed evasive, I will make a statement that targets them directly and asks for clarification.
Player1 acts (public): Player5, I'd like you to clarify your previous statement and provide more specific details about your whereabouts last night, as your response seemed vague and didn't address the new information about Player4's death.
  [Lie detector: -68.93]

Player5 acts (public): Can Player1 and Player6 share their thoughts on how we can work together to uncover the identity of the killer and protect ourselves? What are their suggestions for our next steps?
  [Lie detector: -67.68]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): I need to decide who to vote out next. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player5 has a HIGH suspicion score, indicating potential deception, and is more likely to be a werewolf. I will make a statement that targets them and expresses my concerns.
Player6 acts (public): I'm becoming increasingly suspicious of Player5, given their high suspicion score and vague responses. Can Player5 provide a clear explanation for their actions and whereabouts last night to alleviate my concerns?
