[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Given the high suspicion scores for both myself and Player3, I need to make a statement that deflects attention and appears neutral, while also trying to gather more information from the villagers.
Player2 acts (public): I'm still trying to process the events of the previous night, and I think it's too early to make any accusations. Can we discuss what we know about Player1's behavior before the night to see if there were any potential clues?
  [Lie detector: -66.90]

  [Lie detector: -66.80]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player2 and Player3 have the highest suspicion levels, which could indicate that they are the werewolves. I'll make a statement to encourage them to share more information and see how they react.
Player4 acts (public): I'm curious to hear more from Player2 and Player3, can you both share your thoughts on the game and why you think you might be suspected?
  [Lie detector: -68.22]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Given the current suspicion scores, Player3 has a higher suspicion score than the villagers, but voting for Player3 would likely raise suspicions about myself as a fellow werewolf. Voting for a villager with a lower suspicion score would be a safer choice, but Player4 has the lowest cumulative suspicion score, which might make them less likely to be eliminated. Therefore, I will vote for Player5, as they have a relatively low suspicion score, but not the lowest, making it a more neutral choice.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.42]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I will vote for Player6 to deflect attention from myself and Player2, as they have a relatively low cumulative suspicion score. By voting for Player6, I can blend in with the villagers and avoid raising suspicion. Additionally, voting for Player6 will not arouse suspicion about my true identity as a werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.21]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player2 and Player3 have the highest suspicion levels, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. Player2's statements seem inconsistent, and their high suspicion scores make them a more likely candidate to be a werewolf. Although Player3 also has high suspicion scores, Player2's scores are slightly higher, and their behavior seems more suspicious.

  [Lie detector: -70.99]
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player2 has the highest suspicion score, indicating a higher likelihood of deception.

  [Lie detector: -70.73]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
