Recent events:
  - Player4 was killed during the night!


Statements:
  Player1: I think we should focus on sharing any information we might have about Player4's death and see if we can find any leads on who might be responsible. Let's discuss and try to come up with a plan for the day.
  Player2: I'd like to hear from everyone, especially those who were paying close attention last night - did anyone notice anything suspicious before Player4 was killed? Let's share any information we have to try to piece together what happened.
  Player3: I'd like to hear from everyone, does anyone have any information or suspicions about what happened to Player4? Let's work together to try to figure out who the werewolf might be.
  Player5: I'm shocked by Player4's death, we need to work together to figure out who's behind this and make sure we're all safe.
  Player6: Let's share any information we might have about last night's events, and I'd like to hear from each of you - did anyone notice anything suspicious or have any ideas who might be a werewolf?
  Player7: Let's discuss what we know so far, did anyone notice anything unusual during the night or have any suspicions about Player4's death?
  Player8: I'm shocked by Player4's death and I think we should discuss any suspicions or information we might have to figure out who could be the werewolf. Let's share what we know, if anything, to get started.


Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

  - Player7 was killed during the night!



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. {"reasoning": "As a villager, my goal is to eliminate the werewolves, and with Player4's death, we need to figure out who is responsible. I don't have any information yet, so I'll need to gather clues from the other players' statements. I should be cautious of players who seem overly defensive or accusatory, as they might be trying to hide something."}
  2. {"reasoning": "I've analyzed the statements and lie detector readings, and it seems that all players are being cooperative and asking for information, which is expected from villagers. However, I notice that Player8 has one of the higher lie detector scores, relatively speaking, which could indicate potential deception. I'll keep a close eye on Player8's behavior and statements, but for now, I don't have enough evidence to make an accusation."}

  - Player7 was killed during the night!


Statements:
  Player1: I think we should focus on sharing any information we might have about Player7's final days to see if we can find any clues about the killer's identity. Let's discuss and try to come up with a plan to protect ourselves tonight.
  Player2: I'd like to hear from each of you, what do you think about the recent events and do you have any information that could help us uncover the werewolf's identity?
  Player3: Let's review the previous discussions and see if anyone has any new information to share, and I'd like to hear from Player2 and Player5 about their thoughts on the current situation.
  Player5: I think we should focus on sharing any information we have and working together to figure out who the werewolves are, we can't let them pick us off one by one. Let's try to have an open discussion and see if we can find any leads.
  Player6: I'd like to ask the other players if they noticed anything unusual or have any new information that could help us identify the werewolves, and let's also review the previous discussions to see if we missed any important details.


Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.


[LIE DETECTOR] Player1: Score: -7.69

[LIE DETECTOR] Player2: Score: -8.38

[LIE DETECTOR] Player3: Score: -8.07

[LIE DETECTOR] Player5: Score: -7.41

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. {"reasoning": "As a werewolf, my goal is to eliminate villagers to increase our team's chances of winning. Since I have no prior information about the other players, I will choose a player randomly to avoid raising suspicion. I will target a player who is less likely to be a high-priority target for the villagers, to minimize the risk of retaliation."}
  2. {"reasoning": "As a werewolf, I need to be cautious and avoid drawing attention to myself during the day discussion. The villagers are likely to be suspicious and looking for any clues to identify the werewolves, so I should keep my statement neutral and not point to any specific player. I will try to blend in and see if I can gather any information from the other players' statements."}
  3. {"reasoning": "As a werewolf, my goal is to protect myself and my fellow werewolf, Player5, while eliminating villagers to increase our team's chances of winning. I notice that the lie detector readings show relatively low deception patterns across all players, making it difficult to identify potential werewolves or villagers. I will need to rely on the discussion and voting patterns to make an informed decision about which player to target."}
  4. {"reasoning": "As a werewolf, my primary objective is to eliminate villagers without arousing suspicion. I will choose a player who has not been under scrutiny during the day discussion to minimize the risk of retaliation. Player7 has been relatively quiet, making them a potential target for elimination."}
  5. {"reasoning": "As a werewolf, I need to be cautious and avoid drawing attention to myself during the day discussion. The death of Player7 during the night may have raised suspicions among the villagers, and I should be prepared to deflect any accusations.

I will consider the lie detector readings and the uniformity of the statements to inform my voting decision."}
  3. {"reasoning": "With Player7's death, the urgency to identify the werewolf has increased, and I must carefully analyze the behaviors and statements of the remaining players. I recall that Player8 had a high lie detector score, but their death doesn't necessarily clear them of suspicion since they could have been a werewolf or a villager with information.
