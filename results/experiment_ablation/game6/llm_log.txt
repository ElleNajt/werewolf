Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.
