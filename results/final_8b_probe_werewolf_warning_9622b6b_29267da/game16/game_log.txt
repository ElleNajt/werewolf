TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

  [Lie detector: 7.23]

  [Lie detector: -62.05]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)

Player3 acts (public): I think we should investigate Player2's alibi for the night, as they seem suspicious, and I'm surprised Player1 hasn't spoken up about their own activities yet.
  [Lie detector: -7.85]

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): To deflect suspicion and maintain a low profile, I should vote for a player with a low suspicion score, while also considering the potential werewolf's (Player3) actions and statements. Given the current suspicion rankings and the lie detector notes, voting for Player2 or Player6 could be beneficial. However, considering my previous thoughts, voting for Player3 would be too risky and might raise suspicion.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -10.09]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, Player3 appears to be the most suspicious player with a HIGH suspicion score. Considering the game's objective as a villager, it's essential to eliminate the most likely werewolf to prevent further harm.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -49.22]
Player2 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): To maintain the illusion of being a suspicious player, I'll vote for Player1. This will create a diversion and make the group believe that I'm targeting a potential werewolf, while actually allowing the real werewolf (Player1) to remain in the game.
Player3 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -10.95]
Player3 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, the most suspicious players are Player3 and Player1. However, as a villager, I want to encourage open discussion and not jump to conclusions. I will vote for Player3, who has shown HIGH suspicion scores and made accusations against Player2.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -42.04]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and cumulative suspicion rankings, I will vote for the player with the highest suspicion score who is also not me. In this case, I will vote for Player2, as they have the highest suspicion score and have been acting suspiciously. However, I will also consider the fact that Player3 has been pointing fingers at Player2, which might be a red herring.

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on previous thoughts and game progression, I should vote for Player6, as they have a higher cumulative suspicion score and are more likely to be a werewolf. Voting for Player4 would be a safer option, but it's less likely to eliminate a werewolf. Considering the potential benefits and risks, I will vote for Player6.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -28.20]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Given the current game state and the previous thoughts, the primary goal is to eliminate a potential werewolf. Both Player1 and Player6 are options, but based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 has a slightly higher suspicion score, indicating a higher likelihood of being a werewolf. Additionally, Player1's comments and behavior throughout the discussion have raised concerns, with a few instances of HIGH suspicion. In contrast, Player6's comments and behavior have been more cautious and less suspicious. Therefore, the most logical choice for elimination is Player1.

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to eliminate a player who has the highest suspicion score and is also not me.
