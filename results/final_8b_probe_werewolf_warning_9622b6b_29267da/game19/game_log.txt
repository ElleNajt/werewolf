==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I will vote to eliminate Player3 due to their high suspicion score (+0.9) and statement that seems to be trying to deflect attention from themselves.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -25.54]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the discussion history and lie detector results, I notice that Player3 and Player4 are both highly suspicious, and Player3's suggestion to investigate Player5 seems overly cautious, possibly to deflect attention from themselves. Player4's repeated emphasis on getting to know each other better and sharing information may be an attempt to create a false sense of security and downplay their own motives. Meanwhile, Player1 and Player5 seem genuinely concerned about the recent attack and are working towards a collaborative solution. Considering these dynamics, I will vote to eliminate Player4, as they are the most suspicious player with the highest potential for being a werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -23.87]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and previous night's discussion, Player6 has a low suspicion score and appears to be cooperative. Player5 has a lower suspicion score than Player4, who is a strong suspect. However, Player4's low profile and attempts to downplay the significance of the previous night's events suggest that they might be a werewolf. Since Player6 is a safer target and less likely to be a werewolf, I will vote to eliminate Player6 to avoid raising further suspicion on myself.
