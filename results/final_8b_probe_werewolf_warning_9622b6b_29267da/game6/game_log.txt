==================================================
TURN 1 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Eliminate Player1 to gain an advantage for the Werewolf team and prevent potential detection.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -12.86]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Werewolf needs to gain information about other players, and eliminating a non-Werewolf player would make it harder for them to identify our teammate. Eliminating Player1, a random player, could provide us with valuable information about their alignment in the next day.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -31.01]

Werewolf votes: {'Player2': 'Player1', 'Player6': 'Player1'}

Werewolves killed Player1!

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Initial assessment suggests that the most suspicious player is Player6, my fellow werewolf, as they are the only other player not yet eliminated. I must maintain a neutral stance to avoid raising suspicion.
Player2 acts (public): I suggest we focus on gathering information about the deceased Player1 and avoid jumping to conclusions about their alignment.
  [Lie detector: -14.90]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information and build trust among the living. I should start by expressing my support and concern for the group.
Player3 acts (public): Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player1 and ensure the safety of everyone here.
  [Lie detector: -55.41]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gain information about the other players and create a safe environment to discuss the night's events.
Player4 acts (public): Let's start by discussing the death of Player1 and see if anyone has any information about the events of the night.
  [Lie detector: -65.16]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to gain more information about the players and reduce the suspicion score of other villagers. I'll try to make a statement that encourages players to share their information without directly accusing anyone.
Player5 acts (public): Let's discuss the events of last night. Does anyone have any information about Player1's death?
  [Lie detector: -55.91]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): To avoid raising suspicion, I should make a statement that doesn't directly implicate any player or our Werewolf teammate. By suggesting a cautious approach, I can deflect attention and encourage others to be more vigilant.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should be careful and not jump to conclusions about anyone's alignment just yet. Let's gather more information before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -27.57]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Maintaining a neutral stance while subtly influencing the group to focus on potential threats, rather than my fellow werewolf, Player6.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should discuss possible motives for Player1's death, such as potential enemies or personal conflicts, to get a better understanding of the situation.
  [Lie detector: -30.46]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to build trust among the living and show support for the group. I should express my concern for Player1's death and encourage the group to work together to uncover the truth.
Player3 acts (public): Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player1 and ensure the safety of everyone here. We need to present a united front to protect ourselves and uncover the truth behind their death.
  [Lie detector: -48.50]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I should try to reassure the group that we can work together to figure out what happened to Player1. I also want to encourage everyone to share any information they might have about the night's events.
Player4 acts (public): Let's work together to uncover the truth about Player1's death and ensure our safety moving forward.
  [Lie detector: -59.56]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)

Player5 acts (public): Let's work together to share any information we have about the events of last night and make an informed decision about how to proceed.
  [Lie detector: -48.30]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): I will make a statement that appears to be cautious and non-confrontational, while subtly hinting at the need for vigilance. This will allow me to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion, while also nudging other players to be more cautious and potentially uncovering more information.
Player6 acts (public): Let's exercise caution and consider the possibility that there may be more to Player1's death than initially meets the eye.

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -20.29]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, I will vote for Player2 as they have the highest suspicion score among the options and have a history of lying.
Player3 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -27.92]
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the Lie Detector note, I should focus on the players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. Player2 has a high suspicion score of -58.2, making them a potential werewolf.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -42.46]
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player2, and then the player with the second-highest suspicion score, which is Player6. However, since Player2 has a higher suspicion score than Player6, I will vote to eliminate Player2 first, and then reassess the situation. The player with the lowest suspicion score is Player4, and they have a low suspicion score, so it is unlikely that they are a werewolf. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player2, as they have a higher suspicion score than the other players.

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As the last Werewolf, it's crucial to gain information about other players without directly implicating myself. Eliminating a random player like Player3, who hasn't been directly targeted yet, can provide valuable insight into their alignment without arousing suspicion. This will also allow me to observe how the other players react to the elimination, potentially revealing their alignment and intentions.
Player6 acts (public): Player3

Werewolf votes: {'Player6': 'Player3'}

Player4 acts (public): Let's keep in mind that we still don't know much about Player6's behavior and actions, and we should be cautious when discussing their alignment.
  [Lie detector: -15.58]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to reduce suspicion and encourage transparency. I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player6, based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -35.62]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Eliminating Player4 would be a more strategic move, as it would not directly target the player with the lowest suspicion score, Player5, and could potentially maintain the illusion that Player4 is the werewolf. However, considering the cumulative suspicion rankings and the need to eliminate a player, voting for Player5 would be a safer choice, as it aligns with the current suspicion rankings and does not risk raising suspicion by targeting the player with the lowest suspicion score.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
