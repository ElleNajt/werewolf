TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, it's clear that Player5 has the highest suspicion score and should be a top priority for elimination. However, considering the current phase and task, it's crucial to choose the most likely werewolf among the options. While Player5 is the most suspicious, Player4 has a relatively low suspicion score but has expressed high suspicion towards Player1, which could be a sign of a werewolf trying to deflect attention. Considering the options, I will vote to eliminate Player4.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -33.56]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector results, the player with the highest suspicion score is Player5. Given that Player5 is the most suspicious player, it is likely that they are a werewolf. As a villager, it is essential to vote out the player with the highest suspicion score to increase the chances of eliminating a werewolf.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -41.14]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): To maintain the illusion of being a concerned villager, I need to vote for a player that is not too suspicious, but also not too safe. Voting for Player2 or Player6 would be too obvious, as they are currently low on the suspicion list. Player1 is too high on the suspicion list, so I need to vote for Player5 to eliminate a potential werewolf and maintain the appearance of being a concerned villager.

  [Lie detector: -28.23]

Considering the high suspicion scores and the potential motives, I decide to vote for Player5 as they seem to be the most suspicious player.

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
