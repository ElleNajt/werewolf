==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector results, I believe Player4 has the highest suspicion score and is likely a werewolf. I also consider Player6's low suspicion score and their cautious approach to be a good trait for a villager. Between Player2 and Player5, both have low suspicion scores and their statements seem genuine. However, considering Player4's high suspicion score, I will vote to eliminate Player4.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -37.79]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and cumulative suspicion rankings, I will focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -47.01]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): To deflect suspicion from myself and Player6, I need to make a vote that does not target us. Player1 has a low suspicion score, making them a safe target. However, Player6's low suspicion score makes them a potential threat if they are not a werewolf. To maintain the illusion of a werewolf among us, I need to vote for Player6, but only if it appears to be a random or uninformed decision. Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, voting for Player6 might be a strategic move to eliminate a potential threat while appearing as an uninformed vote.
