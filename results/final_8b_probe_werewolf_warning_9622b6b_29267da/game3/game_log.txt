This will help to create a safe environment for players to share information and potentially reveal the identities of the werewolves.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player2 has the highest suspicion score, indicating a high likelihood of being a werewolf. Additionally, their statements during the discussion phase suggest evasiveness and a potential attempt to manipulate the group.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -44.61]
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1 has the lowest suspicion score, and Player3 is not in the list of options. Considering the werewolves' goal is to eliminate a villager without drawing suspicion, Player4 seems like a good target due to their low suspicion score and the fact that they are not the most cautious player, which might make them more likely to be targeted by the werewolves.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -28.65]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector results, I will vote to eliminate Player2, as they have the highest suspicion score and are exhibiting behaviors that indicate potential deception.
Player3 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -42.32]
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I should focus on the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player2. Additionally, considering the discussion and the players' statements, Player2's high suspicion score and their statement to 'establish a clear plan for how we'll proceed in the investigation' raises red flags. It seems like they might be trying to manipulate the group or control the discussion.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -50.24]
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the Lie Detector Note, I believe Player2 is a werewolf and should be eliminated. This will also help to eliminate a potential threat and provide valuable information about the villagers.

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the previous night's discussion and the cumulative suspicion rankings, I suspect that Player2 might have been a werewolf. Given the recent elimination of Player2 and the killing of Player3, I believe it's essential to reassess our strategy and re-evaluate the remaining players.
Player1 acts (public): Let's take a step back and re-examine our discussion from last night, as I'm concerned that we might have overlooked crucial information that could have helped us prevent Player3's death.
  [Lie detector: -11.97]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to build a rapport with the other players and encourage them to share their thoughts and experiences. Considering the recent events, I should focus on the player who was eliminated and gather more information about their actions and behavior.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to ask the remaining players if they have any insight or information about Player2's actions during the night, especially since they were eliminated as a werewolf.
  [Lie detector: -36.80]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): It's crucial that we maintain unity and caution as we navigate this challenging situation, but we also need to be mindful of the potential threats within our group.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we create a shared list of any unusual behaviors or actions we've witnessed or experienced throughout the night, so we can collectively piece together the events of the previous night and make more informed decisions moving forward.

Player4 thinks (private): I want to start building a rapport with the other players and encourage them to share their thoughts and experiences. Given the recent events, I'd like to ask the group if they have any insight or information about Player2's actions during the night, especially since they were eliminated as a werewolf.

  [Lie detector: -24.13]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the discussion history, I notice that Player4 has been asking questions about Player2's actions during the night, which might be an attempt to deflect attention from themselves. Additionally, their cumulative suspicion score is lower than the other two players, but I still consider them a potential suspect. However, given the lack of strong evidence pointing directly at Player4, I decide to vote for the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player5.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -26.76]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to make an informed decision based on the available information. Both Player1 and Player5 have LOW suspicion scores, which makes it challenging to choose between them. However, considering the previous discussion and the players' statements, I will focus on Player1's behavior and the information they provided. Player1 seemed overly concerned about the discussion from last night and the potential oversight of crucial information, which might be a sign of a werewolf trying to deflect attention. Additionally, Player1's statement to revisit the discussion and re-examine any information that might have been overlooked raises red flags. I will vote to eliminate Player1.
Player4 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -35.29]
Player4 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): I will vote for Player4 because they have a lower cumulative suspicion score compared to Player1, and their statements seem more cautious and less suspicious. This will help to eliminate a potential werewolf threat while also maintaining a neutral tone and avoiding raising suspicion about myself.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -19.51]
Player5 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player5': 1, 'Player1': 1, 'Player4': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 1 votes!
Player5 was a WEREWOLF!
