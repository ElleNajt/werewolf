[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, the most suspicious players are Player3 and Player2. Given the high suspicion scores, it is likely that Player3 is a werewolf. Player2's high suspicion score also suggests they might be a werewolf, but their initial statement about discussing Player4's death had a higher suspicion score than Player3's condolences. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player3, who seems to be the most suspicious.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -43.38]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Given the high suspicion scores of Player3, I must prioritize the elimination of a werewolf. Since Player3 has the highest suspicion score, voting for Player3 would be the most logical choice.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -29.28]
Player2 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player2 and Player6 have lower suspicion scores compared to Player3 and Player1. However, considering the Lie Detector Note, focusing on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves, I will choose the player with the highest suspicion score among the options.
Player5 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -44.14]
Player5 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I have determined that the most suspicious players are likely werewolves.

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As the last werewolf, my priority is to survive and avoid detection. Given the options, I will choose a target that doesn't raise immediate suspicion. Player1 has been considered a potential villager threat, but eliminating them might put me at risk if they are actually a werewolf. Player5 and Player6 are unknown quantities, and targeting one of them might provide an opportunity to eliminate a potential threat while keeping my true nature hidden.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -10.39]

Werewolf votes: {'Player2': 'Player5'}

Werewolves killed Player5!
