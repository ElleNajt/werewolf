==================================================
TURN 1 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate a player who is not a threat to me or my teammate. Since it's the first night, I don't have any information about the other players, but I can make an educated guess based on the fact that Werewolves are typically not the first to be eliminated. I will choose a player who is likely to be a Villager, and Player3 is the least likely to be a Werewolf or a special role.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -24.55]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): no prior information, but Werewolf needs a kill to protect themselves
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -3.86]

Werewolf votes: {'Player2': 'Player3', 'Player4': 'Player6'}

Werewolves killed Player6!

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

  [Lie detector: -58.83]

  [Lie detector: -43.29]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)

  [Lie detector: -34.12]

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the Lie Detector Note, the most suspicious players are likely werewolves. Player5 has the highest suspicion score, which suggests they might be a werewolf. However, the next most suspicious players are Player4 and Player2. Considering the game setup and the discussion history, I will vote for the player with the second-highest suspicion score.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -27.72]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): To eliminate a player without raising suspicion, I need to choose a player who is not a direct threat to me or my teammate. Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player4 has the highest suspicion score, but voting for them may raise suspicion. Player5 has a higher suspicion score than Player3, but voting for Player5 may be seen as an attempt to eliminate a potential werewolf. However, considering the initial thoughts, Player3 is the least likely to be a werewolf or a special role, making them a safer choice for elimination.

TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will analyze the two options.
Player3 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -16.55]
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my primary goal is to protect my fellow werewolf and minimize attention on myself. In the current situation, both Player3 and Player5 have relatively low suspicion scores compared to the previous turns. However, I need to eliminate one player to maintain the illusion of a united front and prevent suspicion from falling on me or my fellow werewolf. Player5 has a higher cumulative suspicion score, which might make them a more attractive target for elimination. I will vote for Player5, as eliminating them will not directly raise suspicion about myself or my fellow werewolf.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -23.68]
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score to prevent potential werewolves from causing harm. In this case, Player4 has a higher suspicion score (-108.9) than Player3 (-212.2). However, based on the discussion history, Player4 has consistently made statements with HIGH suspicion scores, indicating potential dishonesty. In contrast, Player3's statements have been more cautious and less suspicious. Considering these factors, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player4.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -33.32]
Player5 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player5': 2, 'Player4': 1}
