==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): To maintain the balance of numbers, I need to eliminate a Villager. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I should target a player with a lower suspicion score. Player4 has a high suspicion score, which could indicate they are a Villager trying to deflect attention. However, since I am a Werewolf, I should avoid targeting a Villager who might be trying to gather information about me. I will vote to eliminate Player4, as they are a strong candidate for being a Villager and might be more likely to uncover information about me.
