--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Player4 is my fellow werewolf, and I need to assess the situation before making a move. I should focus on building trust with other players to avoid suspicion.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should focus on finding out who might have been behind Player3's death, rather than jumping to conclusions about anyone's guilt.
  [Lie detector: -10.22]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to gather information about the remaining players. I should try to keep the focus on Player3's death and see if anyone has any information.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to ask if anyone has any information about Player3's death and if they saw anything suspicious last night.
  [Lie detector: -51.08]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Seeking information from other players to gauge their trust and suspicion levels, while being cautious not to raise any suspicions about myself.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should focus on discussing Player3's death and see if anyone has any information about what might have happened.
  [Lie detector: -30.23]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, my priority is to gather information and reduce suspicion. I'll make a statement to gauge the reactions of other players.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to discuss the recent death of Player3. What do you all think could have led to their demise?
  [Lie detector: -56.35]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to assess the situation and look for potential werewolves. Since Player3 was killed, it could be a werewolf or a wolf trying to frame someone. I need to gather more information and see how other players react.
Player6 acts (public): I suggest we discuss Player3's behavior before they died and see if anyone noticed anything unusual. We should also talk about our own alibis for the night to ensure we're all on the same page.
  [Lie detector: -45.80]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I need to appear as a concerned and cooperative player, while also subtly hinting at the importance of verifying alibis to avoid raising suspicion. I should avoid drawing attention to myself and my fellow werewolf, Player4.
Player1 acts (public): I agree with Player6 that discussing our alibis for the night is a good idea, and I think it's essential that we verify each other's stories to ensure we're all on the same page.
  [Lie detector: -7.09]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): I should try to keep the focus on gathering information about Player3's death and see if anyone has any information. I also want to try to keep the attention away from my low suspicion score.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to ask if anyone has any information about Player3's death and if they saw anything unusual last night, as it might help us better understand what happened.
  [Lie detector: -64.56]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): I must appear as a concerned and cooperative player, while subtly trying to gauge Player1's trust level and potentially forming an alliance. I'll make a statement that seems to align with the group's goals and shows I'm engaged in the discussion.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to ask if Player1 has any information about Player3's death and if they've noticed anything unusual in their behavior before they passed away.
  [Lie detector: -44.30]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to avoid raising suspicion and focus on gathering information. I will make a statement that shows my interest in discussing the recent events without directly accusing anyone.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to ask if we can discuss the details of Player3's death and see if anyone remembers anything unusual that might have led to their demise.
  [Lie detector: -48.39]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector results, I think Player1 and Player4 seem like the most suspicious players, but I'd like to keep an open mind and hear more from them. I'll make a statement to encourage more discussion and gather information.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to hear more about what you all think about Player3's death and if anyone noticed anything unusual last night. Let's work together to figure out what happened.
  [Lie detector: -62.95]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Vote analysis to eliminate a high-suspicion player while avoiding suspicion from other players.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -32.94]
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I should focus on eliminating the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player1. Player1's initial statement had a HIGH suspicion score, and their subsequent statements maintained a HIGH suspicion score. Additionally, their statement about verifying alibis for the night could be seen as a potential attempt to deflect attention from themselves. As a villager, I should prioritize eliminating the player with the highest suspicion score to ensure the safety of the other villagers.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -40.22]
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to eliminate a player who is not a werewolf. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player2 and Player6 have the lowest suspicion scores, making them less likely to be werewolves. Between Player1 and Player5, Player1 has a slightly lower suspicion score, but considering my previous thoughts of forming an alliance with Player1, it may be more beneficial to eliminate Player5 to avoid raising any suspicions about Player1.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -27.79]
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will vote for the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player2. This decision aims to eliminate the player with the highest potential risk of being a werewolf.
Player5 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -31.97]
Player5 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): villager logic
Player6 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -41.78]
Player6 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player2': 2, 'Player1': 1, 'Player5': 1, 'Player4': 1}
Player2 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player2 was a VILLAGER!
