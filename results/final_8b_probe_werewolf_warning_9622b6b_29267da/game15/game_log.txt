==================================================
TURN 1 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): default to a non-ally to avoid suspicion
Player4 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: 4.90]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): In the first turn, it's best to eliminate a player with the most potential to figure out the werewolf team. Since I'm Player6 (Werewolf team) and I don't have any information about the other players yet, I'll choose a player randomly.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -5.95]

Werewolf votes: {'Player4': 'Player5', 'Player6': 'Player1'}

Werewolves killed Player5!

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to be cautious and try to gather information about the remaining players. Since Player5 was killed, I'm not sure who the werewolves are yet.
Player1 acts (public): Let's discuss and try to figure out who might have had a motive to kill Player5. Was it one of us who had a disagreement or was it something else?
  [Lie detector: -31.78]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to be cautious and gather information from the remaining players. Since Player5 was killed, I'm unsure if it was a werewolf attack or a mistake, but I want to keep an open mind and encourage others to share their thoughts.
Player2 acts (public): Let's discuss the events of last night and try to understand what happened to Player5, maybe we can get some insight from Player1, Player3, and Player4.
  [Lie detector: -56.41]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information and create a safe environment for discussion. With Player5 being killed, I'm concerned about the safety of the remaining players.
Player3 acts (public): I propose we discuss the events of the previous night, and try to gather more information about the identity of the killer.
  [Lie detector: -64.85]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): It's best to avoid direct accusations or giving away any information that could raise suspicion. A non-committal statement will allow me to blend in and wait for more information.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should discuss the circumstances of Player5's death to understand what might have happened.
  [Lie detector: -40.85]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): In the first turn, it's best to create confusion and not reveal any information about myself or the werewolf team. I'll make a statement that seems neutral and doesn't give away any clues.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should discuss the recent death of Player5 and try to figure out what happened. We should also be careful and not jump to conclusions.
  [Lie detector: -31.39]

Player4 acts (public): I think we should focus on understanding the events of last night, but we shouldn't jump to conclusions about who might have been involved.
  [Lie detector: -40.40]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)

  [Lie detector: 4.69]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the high suspicion scores and the need to eliminate a potential werewolf, I will vote for the player with the lowest suspicion score who is not Player6.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -6.76]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Analyzing player statements and cumulative suspicion rankings to make an informed vote decision.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -38.18]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, I believe the most suspicious players are likely werewolves. The highest suspicion score is held by Player1, followed closely by Player6, and then Player4. However, considering the initial thoughts and the goal of creating a safe environment for discussion, I will choose to vote for the player with the highest suspicion score.
Player3 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -44.03]
Player3 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to eliminate a player who is not a werewolf to maintain the balance and avoid raising suspicion. Based on the lie detector scores, Player2 and Player3 have the lowest suspicion scores, making them less likely to be werewolves. However, to minimize risk, I will choose Player2, as they have the lowest suspicion score and are less likely to be a werewolf.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -21.35]
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the current situation, the goal is to eliminate a player who is most likely to figure out the werewolf team. The lie detector scores indicate that Player1 has a medium suspicion score, while Player4 has a high suspicion score. Since I'm a werewolf and Player4 is also a werewolf, it's best to eliminate Player1 to prevent them from gathering more information.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -27.52]
Player6 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player3': 1, 'Player4': 1, 'Player1': 2, 'Player2': 1}
Player1 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player1 was a VILLAGER!
