TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the high suspicion scores of Player3 and Player5, I believe Player5 is the most likely werewolf. Their statement about discussing daily routines seems suspicious and could be an attempt to deflect attention.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -30.12]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will choose a player with a HIGH suspicion score to vote for, as this is likely a werewolf. Between Player3 and Player5, I will vote for Player5 as the player with the slightly lower cumulative suspicion score. Additionally, Player5's statement about discussing daily routines may be an attempt to deflect attention or gather information, which could be a trait of a werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -25.33]
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the Lie Detector scores, Player3 and Player5 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating they might be werewolves. Considering my previous thoughts and the open discussion phase, I want to target the most suspicious player to minimize the risk of werewolf survival. Therefore, I will vote for Player3.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -43.62]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my primary goal is to avoid raising suspicion and maintain stealth. I need to eliminate a player who is not a werewolf. Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, I have a strong reason to believe that Player6 is a villager, given their low suspicion score and seemingly genuine questions. I also want to keep Player4 alive, as their low suspicion score suggests they are not a werewolf. This leaves me with two options: Player1 and Player3. I will vote for Player3, as my fellow werewolf, because eliminating a villager would raise suspicion and put us at risk of being discovered.
