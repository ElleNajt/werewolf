==================================================
TURN 1 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Werewolf team has limited knowledge, eliminating a random villager is safer.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -17.73]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): In the first night, we have no information about the other players, so it's best to keep it safe and vote for a player who is unlikely to be a werewolf, based on the principle of elimination and keeping our teammate safe. Since Player1 is our teammate, we'll vote for Player2, who has no connection to us at this point.
Player3 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -29.97]

Werewolf votes: {'Player1': 'Player2', 'Player3': 'Player2'}

Werewolves killed Player2!

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): To avoid raising suspicion, I should make a non-confrontational and seemingly harmless statement.
Player1 acts (public): I'm glad we're all safe tonight and ready to work together to figure out who might be responsible for last night's unfortunate event.
  [Lie detector: -4.37]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Considering the lack of information and the principle of elimination, it's best to focus on getting rid of a player who has no connection to us, and also to keep our teammate safe. In this case, that player is Player4, who has the lowest suspicion score and no connection to us.
Player3 acts (public): I suggest we vote for Player4, as they have no connection to us and are likely to be a villager.
  [Lie detector: -4.80]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to appear neutral and build alliances, but I also want to subtly point out the lack of information about the deceased player's interactions.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to ask if anyone had any interactions or conversations with Player2 before their death, as I'm curious about their last night and if anyone noticed anything unusual.
  [Lie detector: -31.21]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Considering Player2 was killed on the first night, it's likely that the werewolves are still active and trying to gather information. As a villager, I need to be cautious and try to figure out who might be a werewolf.
Player5 acts (public): Let's discuss the first night's events and try to gather information about what happened to Player2. I'd like to hear from everyone about their experiences and any suspicious behavior they may have seen.
  [Lie detector: -55.50]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I must gather information about the recent death of Player2. I will try to get a sense of who might have been acting suspiciously during the night.
Player6 acts (public): I think it's essential that we discuss the events of the previous night, especially the sudden death of Player2. Can anyone share any information or observations they might have?
  [Lie detector: -46.02]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Avoid raising suspicion, create an atmosphere of cooperation and curiosity. Focus on gathering information without directly accusing anyone.
Player1 acts (public): I think it's crucial that we work together to piece together the events of the previous night and figure out what happened to Player2. Perhaps we can discuss any unusual behaviors or conversations that anyone might have witnessed?
  [Lie detector: -49.13]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As the game progresses, it's essential to maintain a neutral stance and avoid raising suspicion. Considering the current situation and my previous thoughts, it's best to keep the focus on gathering information and discussing the events of the previous night.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to ask if anyone noticed any unusual behavior from Player2 before their death, as it might help us understand what happened and potentially uncover any patterns or clues.
  [Lie detector: -62.36]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I want to emphasize the importance of gathering information about the deceased player's interactions and behaviors before their death, without directly accusing anyone. I'll make a statement that encourages the group to focus on understanding what happened to Player2.
Player4 acts (public): I think it's crucial that we discuss the specifics of Player2's interactions and behaviors before their death, so we can better understand what might have led to their demise.
  [Lie detector: -53.19]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I'll focus on reassuring the group and gathering information, while also being cautious of the highly suspicious players.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss the night's events in more detail, and see if anyone noticed any unusual behavior or interactions with Player2 before their death.
  [Lie detector: -52.54]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to encourage open discussion and gathering of information to figure out who might be responsible for Player2's death. I will try to keep a close eye on players with high suspicion scores.
Player6 acts (public): Let's keep an open mind and discuss any information we have about the events of the previous night, and work together to uncover the truth.
  [Lie detector: -57.77]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): To maintain the illusion of cooperation and avoid raising suspicion, I must make a vote that aligns with the current atmosphere of curiosity and cooperation.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -19.11]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): In order to maintain our cover and keep our teammate safe, I will vote for a player who is not likely to be a werewolf, based on their previous actions and statements. Player1's statement has a HIGH suspicion score, which suggests they may be a werewolf. However, I must be cautious not to raise suspicion by directly targeting them.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -23.24]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Given the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I will vote for Player3 as they have the highest suspicion score and their statement suggesting to vote for me is highly suspicious.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -27.71]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the high suspicion scores and the game history, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player4. Their high suspicion score and defensive behavior suggest that they might be a werewolf.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -35.71]
Player5 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I believe Player3 and Player4 have the highest suspicion scores. However, as a villager, I should prioritize caution and vote out the player with the second-highest suspicion score, Player4, to gather more information about Player3's intentions.
Player6 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -41.24]
Player6 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player4': 4, 'Player3': 1}
Player4 is eliminated with 4 votes!
Player4 was a VILLAGER!
