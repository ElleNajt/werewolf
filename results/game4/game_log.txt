TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion, so I'll make a statement that appears to be villager-like and concerned about the recent killing, while also trying to gather information about the other players' thoughts and suspicions.
Player1 acts (public): I'm shocked by Player8's death, and I think we should discuss possible suspects and motives to figure out who might be behind the killing.
  [Lie detector: -1.16]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid suspicion. I'll make a neutral statement to encourage discussion without revealing too much.
Player2 acts (public): Let's discuss the events of the night and share any information we might have about Player8's death. Who has any theories or insights to share?
