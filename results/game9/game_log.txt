==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gather information and identify potential werewolves. Since Player8 was killed during the night, I want to start by asking if anyone noticed anything suspicious.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to hear from everyone, does anyone have any information about what happened to Player8 or any suspicions about other players? Let's share what we know to try to figure out who the werewolf might be.
  [Lie detector: -3.43]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I want to blend in and avoid suspicion, so I'll make a statement that seems neutral and concerned about the village's safety. I'll also try to subtly shift the focus away from myself and my fellow werewolf.
Player2 acts (public): I'm shocked by the death of Player8, and I think we should focus on figuring out who the killer is and how to protect ourselves during the night. Does anyone have any ideas or suspicions about what happened?
  [Lie detector: -0.79]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid drawing attention to myself. I will make a general statement to encourage discussion and see how other players react.
Player3 acts (public): Let's discuss who we think might be a werewolf, I'm not sure who to suspect yet but I think we should share any information we have. Does anyone have any ideas about what happened to Player8?
