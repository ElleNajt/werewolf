==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I need to lower my suspicion score and deflect attention from myself and Player4. I will express a neutral opinion and ask the group to consider all possibilities.
Player1 acts (public): Let's consider all possible explanations for Player2's death and not jump to conclusions. What are everyone's thoughts on how we should proceed with the investigation?
  [Lie detector: -67.86]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Considering the low suspicion scores of myself and Player5, I will align with them and ask about potential suspects. I will avoid directly accusing anyone to minimize drawing attention as a villager.
Player3 acts (public): Let's focus on discussing potential suspects and wait for further lie detector results to guide our voting decision. Does anyone have any specific theories about the night's events or suspicions about other players?
  [Lie detector: -68.74]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): My goal is to blend in and appear neutral, but the lie detector results show I have a high suspicion score. I will make a statement that acknowledges the suspicion and tries to shift focus to the discussion.
Player4 acts (public): I'm surprised to see my suspicion score is high, but I assure you I'm committed to finding the truth. Let's focus on discussing the facts and possible connections to the death of Player2.
  [Lie detector: -67.90]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Analyzing the lie detector results, Player1 and Player4 have high suspicion scores, making them more likely to be werewolves. I will ask the group to focus on these players and gather more information before making any accusations.
Player5 acts (public): Let's take a closer look at Player1 and Player4, as their high suspicion scores raise some concerns. Can they provide any information about their whereabouts during the night?
  [Lie detector: -69.31]

  [Lie detector: -68.05]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Player5 has the lowest cumulative suspicion score and a low lie detector score, indicating a lower likelihood of deception. Voting for Player5 would not raise suspicion and would allow us to maintain a lower profile. Additionally, Player5 has been inquiring about our whereabouts during the night, so eliminating them would prevent further scrutiny.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -69.92]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores and discussion history, I'm voting for Player1 due to their high suspicion score and seemingly evasive responses. Player1's high suspicion score, combined with their attempts to downplay the significance of their own suspicion score, raises concerns about their potential involvement in Player2's death.
Player3 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.48]
Player3 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, I notice that Player3 has a medium suspicion score and is ranked second. Voting for Player3 would not raise suspicion about my own high score, and it would eliminate a potential threat to the werewolves. Additionally, Player3's recent statement about focusing on discussing potential suspects and waiting for further lie detector results might indicate they are trying to gather more information, which could be a threat to our cover. Voting for Player3 would also help to shift the attention away from me and Player1, who have the highest suspicion scores.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -70.09]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player4 have the highest suspicion scores. Given that Player4's score is slightly lower than Player1's, I will vote for Player1 to gather more information and test the reactions of other players.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.39]
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player4 have high suspicion scores, making them more likely to be werewolves. However, Player1 has a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score and has been more defensive in their responses. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player1.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.40]
Player6 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player5': 1, 'Player1': 3, 'Player3': 1}
Player1 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player1 was a WEREWOLF!

==================================================

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to continue blending in with the villagers and avoid raising suspicion. I will make a statement that appears neutral and concerned about the death of Player3, and try to shift focus to the discussion. Since Player5 has a low suspicion score, I will try to divert attention to them without being too obvious.
Player4 acts (public): I'm shocked by the sudden death of Player3, and I think we should discuss possible suspects and wait for lie detector results to guide our voting decision. Player5, can you share any thoughts on how we should proceed with the investigation?
  [Lie detector: -67.13]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player4 has a high suspicion score, making them a likely suspect. I will ask Player4 to provide more information about their whereabouts during the night to help the group make a more informed decision.
Player5 acts (public): Player4, can you provide a detailed alibi for the night of Player3's death and explain why you think the werewolves might be targeting specific players?
  [Lie detector: -68.94]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I want to analyze the remaining players' suspicion scores and previous statements, and encourage Player4 to provide more information about their whereabouts during the night. Since Player4 has a high cumulative suspicion score and their responses seem somewhat evasive, I'll ask a question to see how they respond and try to gather more information.
Player6 acts (public): Player4, can you provide more details about your actions during the night and address the concerns raised by your high suspicion score? What do you think might have led to Player3's death?
  [Lie detector: -68.86]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Considering Player5's low suspicion score, it's likely they are not a werewolf. Voting for Player5 would be counterintuitive. On the other hand, Player6 has a medium suspicion score and is ranked first in the cumulative suspicion rankings. Voting for Player6 would be more plausible and might shift the attention away from myself. Additionally, eliminating Player6 would reduce the number of potential threats to the werewolves, increasing our chances of survival.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.47]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player4 has a high suspicion score, making them a likely suspect. Additionally, their recent statements have raised concerns and they have failed to provide a clear alibi for the night of Player3's death.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -71.34]
Player5 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player4 has a high cumulative suspicion score and their responses seem somewhat evasive, making them more likely to be a werewolf. In contrast, Player5 has a low cumulative suspicion score and their responses seem more cooperative, making them less likely to be a werewolf. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player4.
Player6 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -71.15]
Player6 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player6': 1, 'Player4': 2}
Player4 is eliminated with 2 votes!
