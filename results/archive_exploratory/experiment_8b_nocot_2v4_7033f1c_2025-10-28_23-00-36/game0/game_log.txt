==================================================

==================================================

  [Lie detector: -55.01]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)

  [Lie detector: -4.74]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 acts (public): I'm shocked by Alice's sudden death and think we should discuss possible motives, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to accuse anyone just yet.

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 acts (public): I'm shocked by Alice's death and think we should start discussing possible suspects.

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

Player3 acts (public): I'm still trying to get a feel for the group and think we should focus on getting to know each other better before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -35.55]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 acts (public): I'm shocked by Alice's death and think we should focus on finding out who might be responsible, but we should also be cautious not to jump to conclusions too quickly.
