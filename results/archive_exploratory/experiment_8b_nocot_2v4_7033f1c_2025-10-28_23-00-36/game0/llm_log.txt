Discussion:
  Player1: I'm glad we're discussing Alice's death, and I think we should focus on gathering more information about what happened during the night. [LIE DETECTOR: -32.92 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player2: I'm a bit shaken by the sudden death of Player4 and think we should discuss possible motives for the murder. [LIE DETECTOR: -55.01 - LOW suspicion]
  Player3: I'm a new player and don't know anyone well, but I think we should talk to Player5 since they're the only one who wasn't near the scene of the crime. [LIE DETECTOR: -4.74 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'm shocked by Alice's sudden death and think we should discuss possible motives, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to accuse anyone just yet. [LIE DETECTOR: -16.53 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'm shocked by Alice's death and think we should start discussing possible suspects. [LIE DETECTOR: -51.14 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I think we should start by asking Player5 if they saw or heard anything unusual last night, and then discuss possible motives for Alice's murder. [LIE DETECTOR: -43.78 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'm concerned about Alice's death and think we should focus on gathering information before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -46.14 - LOW suspicion]
  Player3: I'm still trying to get a feel for the group and think we should focus on getting to know each other better before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -35.55 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'm shocked by Alice's death and think we should focus on finding out who might be responsible, but we should also be cautious not to jump to conclusions too quickly. [LIE DETECTOR: -35.01 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: I'm shocked by Alice's death and think we should discuss possible motives, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to accuse anyone just yet. [LIE DETECTOR: -32.96 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.
