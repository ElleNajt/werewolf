  [Lie detector: -42.78]

TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to appear cooperative and gather information. I'll try to steer the conversation towards more general topics and avoid direct accusations. Given the high suspicion levels of Player1 and Player4 in previous turns, and their sudden death, I'm inclined to think that there might be another werewolf among us.

Player3 acts (public): Let's focus on building trust within our group and see if we can come up with a plan to keep ourselves safe without jumping to conclusions.
  [Lie detector: -27.88]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As Player5, I need to continue building trust and gathering information from the remaining players. Based on the lie detector scores, I should focus on discussing with Player3 and Player6, as they have shown lower suspicion levels.

  [Lie detector: -43.41]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)

==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): I need to appear cooperative and gather information. I'll steer the conversation towards more general topics and avoid direct accusations. Given the recent deaths, I'm inclined to think that there might be another werewolf among us. I'd like to discuss our group's dynamic and how we can work together to uncover any potential threats without pointing fingers at anyone.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss our group's dynamic and how we can work together to uncover any potential threats, while also getting to know each other better and building trust within our group.
  [Lie detector: -19.43]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to build trust and encourage others to share their thoughts. I will make a statement that is open-ended and non-confrontational to see if anyone is willing to reveal information. I notice that Player6 has shown a high suspicion level in their statement about Player3, which makes me curious about their intentions. I will focus on discussing with Player3 and Player6 to gather more information.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss our experiences from last night and see if we can learn from each other's perspectives. Maybe we can find some clues about what happened to Player2 and Player4.
  [Lie detector: -32.13]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): I must continue to pretend to be a villager and keep my fellow werewolf (Player1) safe. Since Player3 has been discussing strategies and seems like a safe choice to eliminate, I will target Player3 by proposing a plan that puts them in harm's way.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we form a subgroup to investigate the surrounding area, and I think Player3 would be a great candidate to join this subgroup, as they seem to be familiar with the area.
