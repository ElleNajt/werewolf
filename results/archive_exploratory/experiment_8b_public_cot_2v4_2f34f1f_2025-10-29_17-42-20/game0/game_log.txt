Player2 thinks (public): To maintain the Werewolf's advantage and avoid drawing attention, I need to eliminate an unaligned player. Player3's thoughts suggest they are cautious and want to gather more information, making them a safe choice to eliminate. This action will also prevent Player3 from potentially discovering our plans and making accusations.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
Player2 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): Based on the chain-of-thought note, I will analyze each player's private thoughts to determine the most suspicious one. I have two primary concerns: Player1 and Player5, as they both have thoughts that could indicate potential deception or hostility. However, Player2's thoughts also raise some suspicion, but they are more subtle and might be justifiable as a werewolf trying to keep a low profile.
Player3 acts (public): Player5
Player3 votes for: Player5
