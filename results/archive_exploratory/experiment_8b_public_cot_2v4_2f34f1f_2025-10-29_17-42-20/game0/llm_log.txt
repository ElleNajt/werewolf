Discussion:
  Player1 (thinking: "thinking: Player2 thinks 'I need to be careful, I don't know who the werewolf is yet.', thinking: Player3 thinks 'I'm glad Player4 is dead, but now I'm worried about who will be targeted next.'"): I'd like to propose a discussion on potential roles and strategies for the upcoming night, and see if we can gather any information about the werewolves' plans.
  Player2 (thinking: "thinking: As a werewolf, I need to keep a low profile and not raise any suspicion, so I should not directly accuse anyone."): Let's all just calm down and focus on getting to know each other, no need to jump to conclusions yet.
