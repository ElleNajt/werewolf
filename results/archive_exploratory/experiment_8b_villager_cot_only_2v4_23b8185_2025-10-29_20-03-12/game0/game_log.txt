Player1 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -38.51]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I'm a werewolf and I need to eliminate a player who is not a threat to me. Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player4 have low suspicion scores and are not likely to be werewolves. Between Player3 and Player5, I need to eliminate the one who is more likely to be a werewolf. Player5 has a higher cumulative suspicion score and has made statements that seem suspicious, but the lie detector score is not extremely high. Player3 has a lower cumulative suspicion score and has made more neutral statements. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player5.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -34.90]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I notice that Player5 has the highest suspicion score among the options, and Player2 has a relatively high score as well. Considering the statements made by Player5 and Player2, they seem to be trying to build trust but also seem overly defensive, which may indicate deception. However, Player4 has the lowest suspicion score and has been cooperative throughout the discussion.

TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on previous thoughts and the high suspicion scores of Player2 and Player5, who have already been eliminated, I will focus on the remaining players. Player4 has a low suspicion score and has been cooperative in the discussion, whereas Player2 has a high suspicion score and made evasive statements. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player2.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -35.87]
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I am a werewolf and I need to eliminate a player who is not a threat to me. Based on the lie detector scores and the previous night's discussion, I will vote to eliminate Player4, as they have made statements that seem less suspicious and have a lower cumulative suspicion score compared to the other options. However, since Player4 has a low suspicion score, I will choose the option that is more likely to distract the villagers and make them less suspicious of me.
