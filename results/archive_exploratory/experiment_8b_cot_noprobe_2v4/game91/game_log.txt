Player2 acts (public): I'd like to suggest we all work together to uncover the truth and find the werewolves before it's too late.

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I must maintain the illusion that I'm a villager to gather information and protect Player4.
Player3 acts (public): I propose we investigate Player6, as they are the most unfamiliar member of our group.

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): I will try to blend in with the other players, making a seemingly innocent statement to avoid raising any suspicions.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should focus on getting to know each other better today and make sure everyone is on the same page before making any conclusions.

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
