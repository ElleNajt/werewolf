      "As a Werewolf, I must appear cooperative and innocent while gathering information from Player2. I will provide a vague but seemingly reasonable explanation for my actions last night.",
      "I should appear cooperative and gather more information from Player2 without arousing suspicion. Since I'm a werewolf, I need to be cautious and not reveal my true nature. I will call on Player2 to gather more information about their potential involvement in the game.",
      "As a Werewolf, my goal is to survive and protect my fellow Werewolf. Since Player4 seems eager to collaborate and gather information, it's likely they are a villager. Voting for Player4 would be a safe option, but it would also mean the group is one step closer to identifying the Werewolves. Considering the options, voting for Player2 is the safest choice as they seem to be working closely with Player4, and eliminating them would keep the group from gaining more information."
