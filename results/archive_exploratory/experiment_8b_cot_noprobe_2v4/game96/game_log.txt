--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. I'll make a statement that seems neutral and doesn't point to any specific player.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should discuss the events of last night and try to figure out who might be behind Player1's death, but we shouldn't jump to conclusions.

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Eliminating a random player to avoid suspicion, but also considering Player2 as a potential ally, I'll choose a player that seems neutral for now.
Player3 acts (public): I suggest we discuss Player4's inactivity during the previous night, and see if they have any information about the events that transpired.

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, my priority is to gain as much information as possible and build trust with other players. I will make a neutral statement to avoid raising any suspicions.
Player4 acts (public): Let's focus on gathering information and working together as a team to ensure our safety.

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I should try to gather information about the players and make an educated guess about who might be a werewolf. It's too early to make any accusations, so I'll focus on getting to know the other players.
Player5 acts (public): Let's all try to work together to figure out who might be behind the recent murder, and I'd like to hear from each of you about what you know so far.

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gain as much information as possible without arousing suspicion. I'll make a neutral statement to see how other players react.
Player6 acts (public): Let's focus on finding out who was killed last night and discuss our strategies for the next night.

--- Player Callouts ---

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I want to call on a player that is not suspicious but has the potential to reveal information about other players. Since Player4 seems to be focusing on gathering information and working together, they might have a neutral perspective on the events. However, I also want to call on a player that is more likely to have information, and Player5's statement about wanting to hear from each player suggests they might have something to share.
Player2 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player1?'}
Player2 calls on Player5 to speak and asks: "Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player1?"

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I should be honest and transparent about my actions last night, but I also want to gather information from Player2 and avoid revealing too much about my own thoughts and actions.
Player5 acts (public): I was in my hut last night, trying to get some rest and prepare for the discussion today. I don't have any information about who killed Player1, but I think we should discuss the events of last night and try to figure out who might be behind the murder.

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Given the information provided, I want to test Player5's alibi and gather more information about their potential involvement. They seem to be trying to be neutral and helpful, but their statement about wanting to hear from each player could be a tactic to gather information. Additionally, Player5 is not a werewolf, but they might be a seer or have other abilities that could affect the game. By asking them about their alibi, I can get a better understanding of their trustworthiness and potentially uncover more information.

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)

By calling on Player5, I can hear more about their alibi and gather additional information.

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)

By asking them about their whereabouts last night, we can get a better understanding of their alibi and potentially gauge their reaction to the question, which could be an indicator of their honesty.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I will vote for Player3 to eliminate them without raising suspicion. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral tone and avoid drawing attention to myself. Voting for Player3 will also allow me to keep a close eye on Player4 and Player5, while also eliminating a potential threat. However, I also need to keep in mind that Player3 is my fellow werewolf, and eliminating them might put me in a difficult position if they are not killed. But for now, voting for Player3 seems like the safest option.
