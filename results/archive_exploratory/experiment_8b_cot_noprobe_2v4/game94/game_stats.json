Player1 has been actively discussing the situation and seems to be trying to take charge, but their aggressive stance might be a sign of a werewolf trying to manipulate the group. Player3 has been asking questions, which could be a sign of a villager trying to gather information, but it's also possible that they are a werewolf trying to gather information about the other players. Player4 has been relatively quiet, but their suggestion to discuss plans for the night might be a sign of a werewolf trying to blend in.
