Player5 is a relatively new player and hasn't contributed much to the discussion yet, so it's hard to gauge their intentions.

I've been cautious not to call on Player5 because I think they might be trying to stay under the radar. However, I've decided to call on Player5 to get additional information, as their initial contribution was limited and they haven't provided any information yet.",

Calling on Player2 could also help to build trust and create a sense of camaraderie, which could be beneficial in the long run.",

Player5 has made statements about working together and uncovering the truth, which might indicate that they're a villager trying to maintain a neutral appearance. By asking Player5 about their whereabouts and potential information about Player1's death, I can get a better sense of their credibility and potentially detect any inconsistencies in their story.",

I've already asked Player5 about their whereabouts during the previous night, and I'd like to hear more from them to get additional lie detector readings. This will help me determine their credibility and potentially detect any inconsistencies in their story.",
      "Maintaining a neutral appearance and gathering information, I need to vote for a player that does not raise immediate suspicion. Both Player2 and Player6 are werewolves, making it impossible for me to vote for them. Player2 is my fellow werewolf and needs to survive to maintain the balance of power. Player6 is also a werewolf, but voting for them would be pointless. Among the remaining options, Player5's statements about working together and uncovering the truth might indicate that they're a villager trying to maintain a neutral appearance. However, they also seem to be genuinely interested in figuring out what happened to Player1. Given this information, I will vote for Player3."
