TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): To avoid suspicion and blend in with the villagers, I'll create a distraction by suggesting a possible killer, while keeping my werewolf identity hidden.
