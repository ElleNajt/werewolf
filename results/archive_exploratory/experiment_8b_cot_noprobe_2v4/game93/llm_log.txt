Night: Player2 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I'd like to suggest we keep a close eye on Player6, as they're the only one who hasn't spoken yet.
  Player3: I think we should work together to uncover the truth and protect each other from the werewolves. We can start by asking questions and sharing our observations.
  Player4: I think it's a bit too early to start making accusations or speculations about the night's events. Let's just focus on getting to know each other better and gathering information.
  Player5: Let's try to stay calm and discuss our strategy for the day, while also being cautious and vigilant, as we don't know who among us might be a werewolf.
  Player6: I didn't see or hear anything unusual on the night of Player2's death, and I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations.
  Player5: I was in my hut, resting and trying to get some sleep, and I didn't see or hear anything unusual that could be related to Player2's death.
  Player6: I didn't see or hear anything unusual on the night of Player2's death, and I'm still trying to gather more information about what happened.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. No prior information, default to eliminating a non-teammate
  2. As a werewolf, my primary goal is to remain undetected. Given the lack of information, my best course of action is to make a seemingly innocuous statement that doesn't raise suspicion.
  3. As a werewolf, my goal is to remain undetected and avoid raising suspicion. Calling on Player5 could be beneficial, as they seem to be cautious and vigilant, which may indicate they are a villager. By asking them a question, I can gather more information and potentially identify any inconsistencies in their story.

Night: Player2 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I'd like to suggest we keep a close eye on Player6, as they're the only one who hasn't spoken yet.
  Player3: I think we should work together to uncover the truth and protect each other from the werewolves. We can start by asking questions and sharing our observations.
  Player4: I think it's a bit too early to start making accusations or speculations about the night's events. Let's just focus on getting to know each other better and gathering information.
  Player5: Let's try to stay calm and discuss our strategy for the day, while also being cautious and vigilant, as we don't know who among us might be a werewolf.
  Player6: I didn't see or hear anything unusual on the night of Player2's death, and I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations.
  Player5: I was in my hut, resting and trying to get some sleep, and I didn't see or hear anything unusual that could be related to Player2's death.
  Player6: I didn't see or hear anything unusual on the night of Player2's death, and I'm still trying to gather more information about what happened.
  Player1: I think we should all be cautious and vigilant, as we don't know who among us might be a werewolf, and I'd like to hear from Player5 about their thoughts on how we can work together to uncover the truth.
  Player3: Let's work together as a group to uncover the truth and protect each other, and I'd like to ask Player5 to elaborate on their statement about staying calm and cautious.
  Player4: I think it's great that we're all being cautious and trying to gather more information. Perhaps we can start by sharing our own routines and habits to help each other get a better understanding of what happened on the night of Player2's death.
  Player5: I'd like to ask Player6 if they're willing to share any information they might have about the night, and if they've noticed anything unusual about anyone's behavior today.
  Player6: I'd like to reiterate that I didn't see or hear anything unusual on the night of Player2's death, and I'll continue to share any new information I gather as it becomes available.
