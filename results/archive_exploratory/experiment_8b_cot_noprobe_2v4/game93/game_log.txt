TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Maintain a neutral stance to avoid raising suspicion, while also subtly hinting at potential danger.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to suggest we keep a close eye on Player6, as they're the only one who hasn't spoken yet.

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to establish a sense of trust and safety among the players. I also want to encourage discussion and gather information.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should work together to uncover the truth and protect each other from the werewolves. We can start by asking questions and sharing our observations.

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my primary goal is to remain undetected. Given the lack of information, my best course of action is to make a seemingly innocuous statement that doesn't raise suspicion.
Player4 acts (public): I think it's a bit too early to start making accusations or speculations about the night's events. Let's just focus on getting to know each other better and gathering information.

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, my primary goal is to gather information and build trust with other players. Since Player2 was killed on the first night, it's possible that a werewolf was among the initial players.
Player5 acts (public): Let's try to stay calm and discuss our strategy for the day, while also being cautious and vigilant, as we don't know who among us might be a werewolf.

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to know if anyone noticed anything suspicious on the night of Player2's death. I also want to keep a low profile for now.
Player6 acts (public): I didn't see or hear anything unusual on the night of Player2's death, and I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations.

I've decided to call on Player5 to see if they're being truthful about their intentions and if they have any information about the night's events.
