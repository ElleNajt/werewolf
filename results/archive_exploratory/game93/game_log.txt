TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): I need to maintain the illusion of being a concerned villager while also ensuring Player3's safety. Since Player3's statements have been relatively neutral, I will not vote to eliminate them.

I will choose a player who is currently ranked high in suspicion, but not too high, to avoid raising my own suspicion.
