==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): No werewolf thoughts revealed yet, need to discuss and gather information.
Player1 acts (public): Let's focus on the mysterious death of Player3 and see if we can find any clues to figure out who the werewolves are.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Since Player3 was killed on the first night, and there are 2 werewolves, it is likely that one of them is still alive and hasn't been revealed yet. I need to be cautious and gather information.
Player2 acts (public): I suggest we discuss the night events and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious, and also ask Player1 if they noticed anything unusual during the night.

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): I need to maintain a calm demeanor to avoid raising suspicion about my true identity as a werewolf.
Player4 acts (public): Let's focus on getting to know each other better and finding out what happened to Player3.

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): I want to maintain the illusion of being a villager and gather information about the other players, so I'll make a statement that seems harmless and encourages discussion.
Player5 acts (public): I think we should focus on finding the real killer and discuss our strategies for the next night. Let's hear everyone's thoughts on the situation.

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): I'm a villager and I want to discuss possible strategies for the night.
Player6 acts (public): Let's focus on building alliances and gathering information to identify potential werewolves.

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): No werewolf thoughts revealed yet, need to discuss and gather information.
Player1 acts (public): Let's focus on the night events and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious that could help us figure out who the werewolves are.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): I want to gather more information about the night events and potential werewolves without revealing too much about my own thoughts or suspicions.
Player2 acts (public): Let's discuss the night events and see if anyone noticed anything unusual or suspicious that could help us identify the werewolves.

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): I need to maintain a calm demeanor to avoid raising suspicion about my true identity as a werewolf. I'll make a statement that seems harmless and encourages discussion.
Player4 acts (public): Let's focus on building alliances and gathering information to identify potential werewolves, and see if we can find any common ground to work together.

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)

Player5 acts (public): Let's discuss possible strategies for the next night and see if we can come up with a plan to uncover the werewolves.

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): I'm a villager and I want to discuss possible strategies for the night, and I think we should focus on building alliances to gather information about potential werewolves.
Player6 acts (public): Let's form a temporary alliance to discuss our individual observations from last night and identify any patterns or suspicious behavior that could indicate the presence of werewolves.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): No werewolf thoughts revealed yet, so I will analyze the discussion for any suspicious behavior or statements that could indicate a werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): no werewolf thoughts revealed yet, need to gather more information
Player2 acts (public): Player4
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): No werewolf thoughts revealed yet, so I will make a random vote to avoid raising suspicion.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): As a werewolf, I need to eliminate a player who is not a werewolf, and I have a fellow werewolf (Player4) to consider. Since Player1 and Player2 are discussing and trying to figure out who the werewolves are, it would be suspicious to vote for them. Player6 is forming alliances and trying to gather information, which could also raise suspicions. Voting for Player4 would reveal my true identity as a werewolf, so I need to eliminate Player6 to maintain the illusion of being a villager.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): No player has revealed themselves as a werewolf in their thoughts, so I'll choose a player to vote out based on their behavior and statements during the discussion.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player5': 1, 'Player4': 1, 'Player2': 2, 'Player6': 1}
Player2 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player2 was a VILLAGER!

==================================================
GAME OVER! WEREWOLVES WINS!
