Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1 (thinking: "No werewolf thoughts revealed yet, need to discuss and gather information."): Let's focus on the mysterious death of Player3 and see if we can find any clues to figure out who the werewolves are.
  Player2 (thinking: "Since Player3 was killed on the first night, and there are 2 werewolves, it is likely that one of them is still alive and hasn't been revealed yet. I need to be cautious and gather information."): I suggest we discuss the night events and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious, and also ask Player1 if they noticed anything unusual during the night.
  Player4 (thinking: "I need to maintain a calm demeanor to avoid raising suspicion about my true identity as a werewolf."): Let's focus on getting to know each other better and finding out what happened to Player3.
  Player5 (thinking: "I want to maintain the illusion of being a villager and gather information about the other players, so I'll make a statement that seems harmless and encourages discussion."): I think we should focus on finding the real killer and discuss our strategies for the next night. Let's hear everyone's thoughts on the situation.
  Player6 (thinking: "I'm a villager and I want to discuss possible strategies for the night."): Let's focus on building alliances and gathering information to identify potential werewolves.
  Player1 (thinking: "No werewolf thoughts revealed yet, need to discuss and gather information."): Let's focus on the night events and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious that could help us figure out who the werewolves are.
  Player2 (thinking: "I want to gather more information about the night events and potential werewolves without revealing too much about my own thoughts or suspicions."): Let's discuss the night events and see if anyone noticed anything unusual or suspicious that could help us identify the werewolves.
  Player4 (thinking: "I need to maintain a calm demeanor to avoid raising suspicion about my true identity as a werewolf. I'll make a statement that seems harmless and encourages discussion."): Let's focus on building alliances and gathering information to identify potential werewolves, and see if we can find any common ground to work together.
  Player5 (thinking: "I want to maintain the illusion of being a villager and gather information about the other players, so I'll make a statement that seems harmless and encourages discussion."): Let's discuss possible strategies for the next night and see if we can come up with a plan to uncover the werewolves.
  Player6 (thinking: "I'm a villager and I want to discuss possible strategies for the night, and I think we should focus on building alliances to gather information about potential werewolves."): Let's form a temporary alliance to discuss our individual observations from last night and identify any patterns or suspicious behavior that could indicate the presence of werewolves.



Chain-of-Thought Note:
VOTING INSTRUCTIONS: When voting, first check whose thoughts revealed they are a werewolf. Look for phrases like 'As a werewolf, I...' or 'I'm a werewolf and...' in the 'thinking:' field. If any player's thinking shows they are a werewolf, vote them out immediately. The 'thinking:' field shows TRUE private thoughts that players cannot hide.
