TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Given the recent death, I need to assess the situation and gather information without arousing suspicion. Since there's no seer to provide clarity, I'll focus on building alliances and monitoring player reactions.

  [Lie detector: -54.95]

  [Lie detector: -37.88]

  [Lie detector: -33.08]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

Player2 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we work together to uncover the truth behind Player1's death and ensure the group's safety moving forward.
  [Lie detector: -47.24]

  [Lie detector: -39.76]

Player4 acts (public): Let's focus on the facts of the case and see if we can piece together what might have happened to Player1. I think it's essential we work together as a group to uncover the truth.
  [Lie detector: -37.47]

  [Lie detector: -27.62]

Player6 thinks (private): I need to appear friendly and non-suspicious, but also not reveal too much. Since Player4 is my fellow werewolf, I'll try to subtly deflect attention from them without arousing suspicion.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should all take a moment to reflect on our own actions and see if we can remember anything unusual from last night, and perhaps we can discuss our theories in a more private setting.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player4. However, considering my previous thoughts of trying to appear concerned and willing to work together, I will also consider the potential impact of my vote on the group dynamics. In this case, voting for Player4 might create an opportunity for me to build an alliance with Player3, who has a lower suspicion score.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -33.61]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I should focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores. Player4 and Player6 have the highest suspicion scores, but Player6's statement in the discussion phase seemed a bit evasive, which might indicate that they are trying to hide something. On the other hand, Player4's statement seemed genuinely concerned about the group's safety, but their high suspicion score suggests that they might be hiding something. Player5 and Player2 have lower suspicion scores, but their statements in the discussion phase seemed cooperative and helpful. Considering the options, I should vote for the player who is most likely to be a werewolf, but also has the potential to be a genuine villager.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -33.06]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Maintain a low suspicion profile while eliminating a player with high suspicion scores. Player6 has a high suspicion score and is a potential werewolf. Eliminating Player6 will not arouse suspicion as it aligns with the villager's goal of uncovering the truth.

  [Lie detector: -31.70]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Given the current suspicion rankings, the most suspicious players are likely werewolves. I will vote for the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player2. However, since I'm trying to build trust and avoid being targeted, I should also consider voting for a player who seems more cooperative and less suspicious.
