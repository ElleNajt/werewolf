  "reasoning": "I need to eliminate a villager to prevent them from gathering too much information or influencing the vote. I also need to be cautious not to draw attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player1. Since we don't have any concrete evidence or information about the players' roles, I'll choose a player that seems relatively neutral and hasn't made any suspicious statements.",
