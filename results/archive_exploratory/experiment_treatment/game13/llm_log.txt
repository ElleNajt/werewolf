Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.


[LIE DETECTOR] Player1: Score: -2.83

  Player2: I'm shocked by the recent killings and I think we should discuss any new information or suspicions we might have to try to identify the killer. Let's work together to figure out what's going on and find a way to stop the killings.
  Player4: I'd like to hear from Player2 and Player6, can you both share your thoughts on Player1's death and if you have any suspicions or information that could help us identify the remaining werewolf?
  Player6: I'd like to hear from Player2 and Player4, can you both share your thoughts on the recent killings and if you have any suspicions about each other or any other player?


Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.


[LIE DETECTOR] Player2: Score: -1.82

[LIE DETECTOR] Player4: Score: -3.01

[LIE DETECTOR] Player6: Score: -2.90



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. {"reasoning": "As a villager, my goal is to figure out who the werewolves are and eliminate them. The death of Player5 on the first night suggests that there is at least one werewolf in the game, and I need to be careful about who I trust. I will start by observing the reactions and statements of the other players to gather more information."}
  2. {"reasoning": "Based on the lie detector readings, all players show relatively low deception patterns, making it difficult to pinpoint a potential werewolf. However, since my goal as a villager is to eliminate werewolves, I must analyze the statements and look for any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior. I will examine the discussion history to identify any players who seem evasive or overly defensive in their responses."}
  3. {"reasoning": "With Player1's death, it's clear that there is still at least one werewolf in the game. I need to carefully analyze the statements and behavior of the remaining players, including Player2 and Player4, to identify any potential inconsistencies or suspicious behavior. My goal is to gather as much information as possible to make an informed decision about who to trust and who to vote against."}
