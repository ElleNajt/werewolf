Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.


[LIE DETECTOR] Player2: Score: -2.64

[LIE DETECTOR] Player3: Score: -0.90

[LIE DETECTOR] Player4: Score: -1.65

[LIE DETECTOR] Player5: Score: -2.66

--- Turn 2 ---
Night: Player2 was killed.

Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.


[LIE DETECTOR] Player4: Score: -1.78

[LIE DETECTOR] Player5: Score: -3.37

[LIE DETECTOR] Player6: Score: -3.13



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. {"reasoning": "As a villager, my goal is to identify and eliminate the werewolves, and with Player1's death, we need to discuss and figure out who could be a potential threat. Since it's the first day, we don't have much information to go on, but we should start by gathering opinions and watching for suspicious behavior. I'll make a statement to encourage discussion and see how others react."}
  2. {"reasoning": "Given the lie detector readings, Player3 has the highest score, indicating potential deception, which raises suspicion. However, it's crucial to consider that the detector may produce errors and that the scores are relative, so I should also look at the discussion and statements for additional context. I will analyze the statements and discussion to see if anyone's behavior or comments seem suspicious or inconsistent."}
  3. {"reasoning": "With Player2's death, the werewolf has struck again, and we're down to three players, which means the werewolf could be either Player4, Player5, or myself. Given that Player3 was the werewolf in the previous turn, the current werewolf's identity is still unknown, and I need to carefully analyze the previous discussions and behaviors to identify any potential suspects. I should also be cautious with my statements to avoid raising unnecessary suspicion on myself."}
