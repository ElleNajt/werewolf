Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.


[LIE DETECTOR] Player1: Score: -2.47

[LIE DETECTOR] Player2: Score: -1.07

My goal is to observe the reactions of other players and gather information without raising suspicion."}
  3. {"reasoning": "As a werewolf, I need to protect my fellow werewolf, Player2, and avoid drawing attention to myself. I will analyze the lie detector readings and discussion statements to identify a villager who appears suspicious or has a high deception score, and vote against them to blend in with the villagers' actions. My goal is to eliminate a villager while maintaining a low profile and avoiding suspicion."}
  4. {"reasoning": "As the last werewolf, my priority is to survive and eliminate villagers to increase my chances of winning. I need to choose a target that will not arouse suspicion and will be believable to the other players. I will analyze the options and select a player that has been relatively quiet or has not drawn attention to themselves during the day discussion."}
  5. {"reasoning": "As the last werewolf, I need to be cautious and avoid drawing attention to myself during the day discussion. With only three players remaining, including myself, I must choose my words carefully to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion. I will try to make a statement that appears neutral or investigative, without revealing my true identity or intentions."}
