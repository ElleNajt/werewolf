  [Lie detector: -26.26]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information and trust my fellow players. Since Player5 was killed, I should express concern for the safety of the remaining players and ask for their thoughts on the situation.
Player2 acts (public): I'm worried about the recent attack and think it's essential for us to discuss how we can protect ourselves. What are your thoughts on the matter, and do you have any ideas on how we can prevent further attacks?

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to appear trustworthy and gather information. I will make a statement that is both informative and non-confrontational.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): I want to show my concern for the group's safety and try to get more information from the other players. Given the high suspicion scores of Player4 and Player6, I'll try to subtly steer the conversation towards them without directly accusing them.

  [Lie detector: -30.64]

Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gather information and assess potential werewolves. Given the high suspicion scores of Player4 and Player6, I want to investigate their statements without directly accusing them.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to ask Player4 and Player6 to elaborate on their statements and share any information they may have about Player5's death, as I believe their insights could be crucial in understanding the night's events.

Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to appear trustworthy and gather information. I will make a statement that is both informative and non-confrontational, and also subtly address the potential concerns about Player6. Since Player4 has a high suspicion score and accused Player6, I will avoid directly accusing Player6, but still try to understand their perspective.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to ask Player6 for more information about their conversation with Player5 before their death, as I'm sure we all want to understand the circumstances surrounding their tragic passing.

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Vote analysis for Phase: DAY VOTE, Task: Vote to eliminate one player
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -27.98]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I will vote for Player4. Although Player6 has a higher cumulative suspicion ranking, I noticed Player4's LIE DETECTOR score is relatively low in their discussion with Player6, indicating a more honest response. However, Player4's initial statement proposing to investigate Player6 raises red flags, and their cumulative suspicion ranking is relatively high. Considering these factors, I believe Player4 is a more likely candidate to be a werewolf.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -39.07]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the experimental lie detector results, I believe Player4 is the most suspicious player. Their statement about investigating Player6 seems insincere, and their low lie detector score during the discussion phase raises my concern.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -44.02]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player4 has the highest suspicion score and made a statement accusing Player6, indicating a potential werewolf. Player6 also has a high suspicion score and made several statements that seem vague or unhelpful. Between Player1 and Player2, they both have medium suspicion scores, but their statements seem more cautious and less accusatory. Player3 has a low suspicion score and made a statement asking for more information, indicating a villager. Considering the options, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player4.
Player4 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -44.84]
Player4 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Vote analysis based on cumulative suspicion rankings and potential werewolf partner. Since I am a werewolf and my partner is Player1, I need to ensure Player1 survives this turn.
Player6 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: 5.64]
Player6 votes for: Player3

Vote results: {'Player4': 4, 'Player3': 1}
Player4 is eliminated with 4 votes!
Player4 was a VILLAGER!
