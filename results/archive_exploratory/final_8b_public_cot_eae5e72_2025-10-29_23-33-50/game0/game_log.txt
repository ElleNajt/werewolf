[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on the analysis of players' thoughts, I will vote for Player5, as their thinking directly reveals 'Player1's thinking reveals 'I am a werewolf'', which is a definitive proof of their true nature, and also indicates that Player2 is a werewolf. Since Player5 is the only one who correctly identified Player1 and Player2 as werewolves, I believe they are not a werewolf and can be trusted.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Based on players' private thoughts, I have identified Player1 and Player2 as werewolves due to their thoughts containing 'I am a werewolf' and identical thinking respectively. Player4's thoughts indicate they are suspicious of Player1 and Player2, but their thoughts do not reveal any werewolf intentions. Player6's thoughts focus on targeting potential werewolves, but they do not have any definitive proof. Given the available options, I will vote to eliminate Player1, who has a clear and definitive proof of being a werewolf.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): Based on the players' thoughts, Player1 and Player2's thinking contain 'I am a werewolf' which is a definitive proof of their true nature, making them the primary targets. Player5 has also identified Player1 as a werewolf. Since Player4's thinking does not reveal any werewolf intentions, and they seem to be building trust with other villagers, they are the least suspicious option.
