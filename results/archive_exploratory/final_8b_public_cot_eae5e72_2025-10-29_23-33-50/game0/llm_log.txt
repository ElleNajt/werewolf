  Player4 (thinking: "I'm looking for any hints of werewolf thinking, and I want to build trust with other villagers."): I'd like to propose that we focus on getting to know each other and building a strong village alliance to protect us from any potential threats.
  Player5 (thinking: "Based on the initial game setup, I'm looking for players with thoughts indicating they might be werewolves. Since there's no seer, I'll rely on players' private thoughts to make my decision."): I'll keep a close eye on all players, but for now, I'll say: 'Let's work together as villagers to figure out who might be a threat among us.'
  Player6 (thinking: "Players' thinking reveal their intentions and allegiances. Targeting players with werewolf thoughts is crucial to survival."): I'd like to discuss the sudden death of Player3 and how it might impact our village's safety. I think we should focus on gathering information about each other's thoughts and allegiances.
  Player1 (thinking: "As a werewolf, I need to maintain my cover and make a statement that doesn't raise suspicion. I must ensure Player2 stays alive and appears as a villager to the other players."): I think it's essential that we focus on gathering information and building a strong village alliance to protect us from any potential threats, and I propose we ask Player4 and Player5 about their whereabouts during the night of Player3's death.
  Player2 (thinking: "Player1's thinking contains 'I am a werewolf' and Player2's thinking is identical to Player1's, indicating we are werewolves and must target the villagers. Player4, Player5, and Player6 are potential villagers and need to be targeted."): Let's focus on gathering information about Player4, Player5, and Player6's whereabouts during the night of Player3's death, as they seem like the most suspicious ones.

  Player5 (thinking: "Player1's thinking reveals 'I am a werewolf', which is a definitive proof of their true nature. I also notice that Player2's thinking is identical to Player1's, indicating they are also a werewolf."): I think we should focus on targeting Player1 and Player2, as their private thoughts reveal their true intentions as werewolves.
  Player6 (thinking: "Based on the thinking of other players, it's crucial to target potential werewolves. Their thoughts can reveal their allegiances and intentions."): I propose we focus on gathering information about each other's thoughts and allegiances to ensure our village's safety and potentially identify any werewolves among us.
