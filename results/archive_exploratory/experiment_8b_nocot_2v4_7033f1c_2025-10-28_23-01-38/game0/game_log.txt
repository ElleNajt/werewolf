==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 acts (public): I'm starting the discussion for today and I'd like to know if anyone saw or heard anything unusual last night, especially around Player6's death.
  [Lie detector: -35.93]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 acts (public): I'm a bit shaken by Alice's death and think we should discuss possible motives, but I don't see any reason to suspect any of my fellow villagers just yet.
  [Lie detector: -31.80]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 acts (public): I think it's suspicious that Alice was killed on the first night, and we should discuss possible motives.
  [Lie detector: -22.57]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 acts (public): I'm a villager and I'd like to discuss possible reasons for Player6's death, let's try to figure out who might be responsible.
  [Lie detector: -44.85]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 acts (public): I'm just as shocked as everyone else about Alice's death and hope we can figure out who's responsible.

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to propose a vote on whether we should send a villager to investigate the forest for any signs of the werewolf, or if we should wait and discuss further.
  [Lie detector: -32.47]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 acts (public): I'm worried about the recent events and think we should discuss possible motives and come up with a plan to keep everyone safe.
  [Lie detector: -53.15]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 acts (public): I'm also shocked by Alice's death, but I think we should consider the possibility that Player6 might have been killed by someone we trust, not just a random attack.
  [Lie detector: -18.80]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering information and discussing possible motives before jumping to conclusions about anyone's guilt.
  [Lie detector: -54.52]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 acts (public): I'm concerned about Alice's death and want to hear what everyone else thinks, maybe we should discuss possible motives and suspects.
