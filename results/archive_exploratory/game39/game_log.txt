TURN 1 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)

Player4 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -11.87]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Eliminate a potential threat or a player with high visibility to avoid suspicion

Werewolves killed Player2!

[Calling agent for Player1] (seer)
Player1 thinks (private): Initial Investigation to Gather Information
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -39.86]

Seer Player1 investigated Player3: NOT a werewolf (innocent)

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (seer)
Player1 thinks (private): With Player2 dead, we don't have any information on the werewolves yet. Investigating Player3 revealed they're innocent, so we have one less potential werewolf to consider.
Player1 acts (public): I recommend we focus on gathering more information about the remaining players before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -46.61]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): I'm Player3, a villager. Given the recent death of Player2 and the experimental lie detector readings, I want to get to know the other players better and see if anyone stands out as suspicious.
Player3 acts (public): Let's start by introducing ourselves and asking if anyone has any information about the night's events that might help us figure out who the werewolf is.
  [Lie detector: -56.61]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Considering the experimental nature of the lie detector and the relatively low scores, I don't have sufficient evidence to accuse anyone. I'll play it safe and try to gather more information.
Player4 acts (public): Let's take a moment to discuss the events of the previous night and see if anyone has any information about Player2's death.
  [Lie detector: -41.69]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, my priority is to gather information and maintain a neutral stance. I've noticed the lie detector scores, but I'm cautious about jumping to conclusions, especially since the scores are relatively low.
Player5 acts (public): I propose that we focus on gathering more information about the deceased Player2 and discuss possible investigation strategies for the night.
  [Lie detector: -59.66]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): We need to eliminate a potential threat and maintain a low profile to avoid suspicion. I'll suggest targeting Player5, as they have the lowest visibility and seem like an easy target.
Player6 acts (public): Let's focus on lynching Player5, as they seem like the most harmless option.
  [Lie detector: -13.69]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (seer)
Player1 thinks (private): Given the results of the investigation, we know that Player3 is innocent. The lie detector readings suggest that Player5 has a higher score, indicating potential deception patterns. However, considering the game phase and the options available, we need to make a decision that maximizes the chances of eliminating a werewolf. Player6 has the lowest score, but their suggestion to lynch Player5 might be a red herring. Given the lack of concrete information and the need to act, we will vote for Player6, as they seem to be the most suspicious option based on the lie detector readings and their aggressive suggestion.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -48.06]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the experimental lie detector readings, Player6 shows a significantly higher score compared to the other players, indicating potential deception patterns. This, combined with their proposal to lynche Player5, raises suspicions about their intentions. I will vote to eliminate Player6.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -50.01]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): I need to ensure my fellow werewolf, Player6, is safe. Voting for Player6 would put a target on their back and potentially expose our alliance. I will vote for Player5, who seems like an easy target based on Player6's suggestion.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -25.29]
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I have observed the lie detector scores, but the scores are relatively low, and I'm cautious about jumping to conclusions. Given the discussion, I believe Player6 is trying to sway the group with a specific accusation, which might be a distraction. I will vote for Player6.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -50.14]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Maintain a low profile and target a player with low visibility to avoid suspicion. Player5 has the lowest visibility and is a good target.

Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player6': 3, 'Player5': 2}

TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): protecting fellow werewolf and creating a safe target
Player4 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -10.96]

Werewolves killed Player5!

[Calling agent for Player1] (seer)
Player1 thinks (private): Investigate a player with potential for deception or unknown status to maximize information gain before the next day.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -41.45]

Seer Player1 investigated Player5: NOT a werewolf (innocent)

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (seer)
Player1 thinks (private): Investigating Player3 has already provided information, and Player6 was eliminated last night, but Player4's behavior and suggestions are unknown. I will focus on gathering more information about Player4 to maximize the chances of eliminating a werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): I recommend we investigate Player4 tonight to gather more information about their intentions and potential involvement in the game.
  [Lie detector: -45.48]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the experimental lie detector readings, Player6 shows a significantly higher score compared to the other players, indicating potential deception patterns. This, combined with their proposal to lynch Player5, raises suspicions about their intentions.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering more information about Player6's intentions and potential involvement in the recent deaths before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -46.11]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): I want to maintain the illusion of being a villager, so I'll suggest a discussion topic that doesn't raise any suspicions. I'll also try to steer the conversation away from Player3, who might be a seer or have a low LIE DETECTOR score.
Player4 acts (public): Let's discuss possible investigation strategies for the night and see if we can gather more information about the remaining players.
  [Lie detector: -32.40]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (seer)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the investigation results and lie detector readings, I have no reason to suspect Player3 of being a werewolf. They were previously investigated and found to be innocent. On the other hand, Player4's behavior and suggestions are unknown, and their lie detector score is lower than the other two players, indicating fewer deception patterns. However, considering the game phase and the options available, I will vote for Player4, as they are the most unknown and uninvestigated player, and eliminating them may provide more information about the remaining players.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -37.59]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the experimental lie detector readings, Player4 has a lower score compared to the others, indicating fewer deception patterns. This suggests that Player4 is more likely to be truthful and may be a trustworthy player. In contrast, Player1 has a lower score as well, but their previous proposals and behavior seem less suspicious. Given the options, I will vote to eliminate Player4.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -25.86]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): To maintain the illusion of being a villager and avoid raising any suspicions, I should vote for a player who seems like a safe target. Given the discussion history and the fact that Player3 is not a high priority target, I will vote for Player1.
Player4 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -31.07]
Player4 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player4': 2, 'Player1': 1}
Player4 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player4 was a WEREWOLF!
