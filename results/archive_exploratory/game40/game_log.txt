TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information about the players. I'll start by making a statement that encourages discussion without revealing too much.

Player2 thinks (private): Based on the Lie Detector scores, Player5 has the highest score (-41.97), indicating a strong deception pattern.
