  Player2 (thinking: "My previous thoughts were about targeting Player1 as a potential threat or scapegoat, but now that they're dead, I'll focus on gaining information and gathering allies. I'll make a statement to appear as a potential ally to the villagers."): I think we should work together to find the truth and ensure everyone's safety, let's focus on gathering information and building trust among us.
  Player3 (thinking: "As a villager, my primary goal is to survive and uncover the identities of the werewolves, but I still have no concrete information to base my decisions on."): Let's continue to discuss our strategies and gather information about each other before making any decisions, and see if we can uncover any patterns or clues about the werewolves' identities.
  Player4 (thinking: "As a werewolf, I need to target a non-teammate to gain information. I also need to appear neutral to avoid suspicion."): Let's focus on finding out more about Player3, they seem like a good starting point for discussion.
  Player5 (thinking: "As a villager, my primary goal is to survive and uncover the identities of the werewolves. Since Turn 1 only revealed the death of Player1, I have no information about any werewolves yet, and I believe we should focus on gathering information and getting to know each other."): I think we should have an open discussion about our individual strategies and see if anyone has noticed anything suspicious.
  Player6 (thinking: "No werewolves have revealed themselves yet, so I will remain cautious and encourage discussion to gather more information."): I think it's crucial that we discuss the events of last night and try to figure out who might be a werewolf, perhaps someone noticed something suspicious.



Chain-of-Thought Note:

Based on my previous thoughts, I will continue to prioritize survival and gathering information. Since Player4 has shown interest in discussing Player3, I will keep an eye on them. However, I have no concrete reason to vote out Player2, Player4, Player5, or Player6 at this time. I will vote for Player4, as they seem to be taking an interest in me, but I have no concrete evidence to base my decision on.", "action": "Player4"}

  "reasoning": "Player2 is a fellow werewolf, so voting them out is not a viable option. Among the remaining players, Player3 seems like a good target to gain information, but no player has revealed themselves as a werewolf.
