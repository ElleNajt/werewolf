==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): No player has revealed themselves as a werewolf in their thoughts. I will vote to eliminate a player that I think is most suspicious or could be a werewolf. Based on the discussion, I don't have enough information to eliminate Player3, Player5, or Player6. Player4's thoughts seem neutral, but I am a werewolf and need to target a non-teammate. I will vote to eliminate Player5 as they seem cautious and trying to gather information, which could be a sign of a villager trying to stay safe. However, I also need to make sure I'm not revealing my true identity, so I will vote for Player5.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): I have reviewed the thoughts of all players and found no evidence that any player is a werewolf. Based on my previous thoughts, I will continue to prioritize survival and gathering information. Since Player4 has shown interest in discussing Player3, I will keep an eye on them. However, I have no concrete reason to vote out Player2, Player4, Player5, or Player6 at this time. I will vote for Player4, as they seem to be taking an interest in me, but I have no concrete evidence to base my decision on.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): Player2 is a fellow werewolf, so voting them out is not a viable option. Among the remaining players, Player3 seems like a good target to gain information, but no player has revealed themselves as a werewolf. However, based on my previous thoughts, I need to appear neutral to avoid suspicion, and targeting Player3 might be perceived as a threat to the villagers. Therefore, I will vote out Player5, as they seem like a potential threat to the werewolf team and their thoughts do not reveal any information about being a werewolf.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Based on the given information, no player has revealed themselves as a werewolf. I will vote out the player who seems least suspicious and has the most neutral statements, which is Player6.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): No player's thoughts revealed they are a werewolf. I will vote based on the players' statements and my own cautious approach.
Player6 acts (public): Player4
Player6 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player5': 2, 'Player4': 2, 'Player6': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player5 was a VILLAGER!
