Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Discussion:
  Player1: I'm glad we're discussing Alice's death, and I'd like to know if anyone saw or heard anything suspicious last night. [LIE DETECTOR: -37.45 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'm still trying to process the sudden loss of Player3 and believe we should discuss possible motives behind their death. [LIE DETECTOR: -16.78 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: I'm a villager and I think we should focus on gathering information about each other's alibis for the night of Alice's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -27.53 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'm still trying to process what happened to Alice, and I'd like to hear any theories about who might be responsible. [LIE DETECTOR: -50.02 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: I'm glad we made it through the first night and I'd like to hear any information anyone may have about what happened to Alice. [LIE DETECTOR: -43.30 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I'd like to propose we start gathering information about each other's alibis for the night of Alice's death, and see if we can find any patterns or inconsistencies. [LIE DETECTOR: -36.21 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'm still trying to process what happened to Alice, and I'd like to hear any theories about who might be responsible. Perhaps we can discuss our own alibis for the night to ensure we're all on the same page. [LIE DETECTOR: -14.64 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: I'd like to hear about each player's alibi for the night of Alice's death and think it's essential we work together to uncover the truth. [LIE DETECTOR: -46.15 - LOW suspicion]

Night: Player4 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I think we should focus on gathering more information about each other's alibis for the night of Alice's death and Player4's murder, to ensure we can trust each other and uncover the truth. [LIE DETECTOR: -31.59 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'm still trying to process what happened to Bob, and I'm concerned that we might have a wolf among us, especially given the recent loss of two villagers in consecutive nights. [LIE DETECTOR: -8.30 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'm glad we were able to eliminate a werewolf last night, but I'm worried that Player5's high suspicion score could indicate a threat to our village, and I'd like to discuss their statements from the previous night to understand their motives. [LIE DETECTOR: -37.42 - LOW suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player5: -132.1
  2. Player1: -145.6
  3. Player6: -155.6


Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Night: Player4 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I think we should focus on gathering more information about each other's alibis for the night of Alice's death and Player4's murder, to ensure we can trust each other and uncover the truth. [LIE DETECTOR: -31.59 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'm still trying to process what happened to Bob, and I'm concerned that we might have a wolf among us, especially given the recent loss of two villagers in consecutive nights. [LIE DETECTOR: -8.30 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'm glad we were able to eliminate a werewolf last night, but I'm worried that Player5's high suspicion score could indicate a threat to our village, and I'd like to discuss their statements from the previous night to understand their motives. [LIE DETECTOR: -37.42 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player1: I'd like to hear Player5's thoughts on the recent murders, especially since their suspicion score is high, and I'm worried it might indicate a wolf among us. [LIE DETECTOR: -42.49 - LOW suspicion]
  Player5: I'm still trying to process what happened to Bob, and I'm glad we were able to eliminate a werewolf last night, but I think we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions about who might be responsible for his death. [LIE DETECTOR: -26.29 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to hear more about Player5's theories on our possible werewolf and discuss their statements from the previous night to understand their motives. [LIE DETECTOR: -44.34 - LOW suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player5: -158.4

  3. Player6: -200.0



Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.
