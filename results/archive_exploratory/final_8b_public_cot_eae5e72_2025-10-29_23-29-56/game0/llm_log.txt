Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Eliminate a random villager to avoid raising suspicion
  2. I need to maintain a neutral stance and not raise suspicion, but also I should try to gain information about other players' thoughts.
  3. I need to maintain a neutral stance and not raise suspicion, but also I should try to gain information about other players' thoughts. I'll make a statement that appears neutral and innocuous, while actually trying to gauge other players' reactions.
