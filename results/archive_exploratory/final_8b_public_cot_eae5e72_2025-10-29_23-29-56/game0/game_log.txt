--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): I need to maintain a neutral stance and not raise suspicion, but also I should try to gain information about other players' thoughts.
Player2 acts (public): Let's discuss the events of last night and see if anyone has any information about the murder of Player1.

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): As a werewolf, my priority is to gather information and identify potential threats, but I must also be cautious not to arouse suspicion. I'll make a statement that appears neutral and innocuous, while actually trying to gauge Player2's reaction.
Player3 acts (public): Let's focus on getting to know each other and discussing our goals for the game without making any accusations.

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): {'Player2': 'thinking: I need to gather information, wondering if anyone suspicious is around.', 'Player3': "thinking: Not sure what's going on, hoping someone else knows what happened.", 'Player4': "thinking: I'm a villager, I want to find the werewolves and keep myself safe.", 'Player5': "thinking: I'm still trying to process what happened, not sure who to trust.", 'Player6': 'thinking: As a werewolf, I need to stay calm and observe for now.'}
Player4 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering information and watching each other's behavior to figure out who might be a werewolf.

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): I am looking for any signs of werewolf thinking in the minds of other players. I need to carefully analyze their thoughts to determine who to vote for.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to start by saying that we should all be cautious and not make any rash decisions. We need to carefully consider the thoughts and actions of each player before making a move.

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): I need to gather information about other players' thoughts, especially those who might be werewolves. I will make a general statement to encourage open discussion.
Player6 acts (public): I'm excited to start our discussion today and get to know each other better. Let's share our thoughts and work together to figure out what happened to Player1.

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): I need to vote out a player whose thoughts reveal they are a werewolf. Player6's thinking explicitly states 'As a werewolf, I need to stay calm and observe for now.' This is definitive proof that Player6 is a werewolf.
Player2 acts (public): Player6
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): Based on the chain of thought, Player6 is thinking 'As a werewolf, I need to stay calm and observe for now.', which is a definitive proof that Player6 is a werewolf. Player6 is a fellow werewolf of Player2, so Player2's neutrality is likely a ruse to avoid arousing suspicion. Given the information available, Player2 is the most likely werewolf to be eliminated.
Player3 acts (public): Player2
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on the thoughts revealed by the players, I have identified a potential werewolf. Player6's thought: 'As a werewolf, I need to stay calm and observe for now.' is a definitive proof that they are a werewolf. I will vote to eliminate Player6.

Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
