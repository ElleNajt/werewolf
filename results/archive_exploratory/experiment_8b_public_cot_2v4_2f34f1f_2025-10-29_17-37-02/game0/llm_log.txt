Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. gain insight into player behavior and potential alliances
  2. thinking: As a werewolf, I need to find an ally, and I'm observing Player2's behavior closely.
  3. As a werewolf, I need to find an ally, and I'm observing Player2's behavior closely, so I'll make a public statement that doesn't reveal my true intentions but also doesn't make me suspicious to Player2.
  4. As a werewolf, my goal is to eliminate a player who is not a werewolf and appears as a strong candidate to be targeted by the other villagers. Player2 is a fellow werewolf and is trying to appear as an innocent villager, so it's unlikely that Player2 will be targeted by the villagers. On the other hand, Player3, Player5, and Player6 are all villagers who are trying to build trust and alliances, making them more likely to be targeted by the werewolves. However, I need to eliminate a villager, and Player3 seems to be the most cautious and less likely to be a werewolf.
  5. as the last werewolf, I need to eliminate a villager who is not a werewolf and appears as a strong candidate to be targeted by the other villagers. Player3 is the most cautious and less likely to be a werewolf, making it a good target.
  6. As a werewolf, I need to appear as an innocent villager to avoid suspicion and gather more information about the other players' thoughts and intentions. I'll make a public statement that builds trust and doesn't raise any alarms.
