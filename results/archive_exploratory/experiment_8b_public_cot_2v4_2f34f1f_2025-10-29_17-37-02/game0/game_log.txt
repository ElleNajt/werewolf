[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)

Player2 is a fellow werewolf and is trying to appear as an innocent villager, so it's unlikely that Player2 will be targeted by the villagers. On the other hand, Player3, Player5, and Player6 are all villagers who are trying to build trust and alliances, making them more likely to be targeted by the werewolves. However, I need to eliminate a villager, and Player3 seems to be the most cautious and less likely to be a werewolf.

Player4 thinks (public): I have analyzed the players' private thoughts and intentions. Player5's private thoughts do not indicate any suspicious behavior, and their public statements seem to be genuine. On the other hand, Player6 has noticed that my private thoughts are suspicious, which means they are aware of my true identity as a werewolf. This makes Player6 a potential threat to me, and I need to eliminate them to stay safe.
