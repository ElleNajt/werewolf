--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Since Player2 was killed on the first night, I suspect there might be a werewolf among us. I will try to gather more information by asking questions to see if anyone noticed anything suspicious.
Player1 acts (public): I propose we discuss the events of the previous night and see if anyone has any information about what happened to Player2.
  [Lie detector: -59.50]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I am a werewolf, and my goal is to gain more information and create a false sense of security among the villagers. To achieve this, I need to make a statement that doesn't raise immediate suspicion, but also doesn't provide any concrete information.
Player3 acts (public): I propose that we discuss the recent death of Player2 and try to gather more information about the circumstances of their death.
  [Lie detector: -45.55]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Since Player2 was killed on the first night, it's likely that a werewolf was among the group from the start. Given that I'm a villager, I need to find out who the werewolves are before they target me.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should focus on questioning players who were alive during the first night, especially those who had interactions with Player2 before she was killed.
  [Lie detector: -20.21]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Eliminate Player2 as they have no prior connection to Werewolf team. I will pretend to be a villager for now and gather information.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to discuss possible strategies to protect our village and find the remaining werewolf(s).
  [Lie detector: -10.60]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Given the recent death of Player2, I am concerned that the werewolves might be trying to eliminate the villagers before we can gather information. I suggest we discuss possible alliances and keep a close eye on players with suspicious behavior.
Player6 acts (public): Let's discuss possible alliances and keep a close eye on players with suspicious behavior.
  [Lie detector: -32.84]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): I want to create a safe environment for discussing the events of the previous night without accusing anyone directly. I will propose a neutral statement to start the discussion.
Player1 acts (public): I propose we discuss the events of the previous night in a calm and respectful manner, focusing on gathering information rather than accusations.
  [Lie detector: -51.62]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I want to create a false sense of security among the villagers and make them believe I'm cooperative. I will make a statement that seems harmless and doesn't raise immediate suspicion.
Player3 acts (public): I agree with Player1 that we should discuss the events of the previous night and see if anyone has any information about what happened to Player2. I think it's a great idea to gather more information and work together to keep our village safe.
  [Lie detector: -20.55]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to keep a low profile and avoid raising suspicion. I will make a statement that seems cooperative and does not directly accuse anyone.
Player4 acts (public): I think it's a good idea to gather more information about Player2's death and see if anyone has any clues about what happened.
  [Lie detector: -49.39]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): I will pretend to be a villager and gather information, while trying to subtly point out Player4 as a potential threat to the village, without arousing suspicion.
Player5 acts (public): I agree with Player4's suggestion to question players who were alive during the first night, but I think we should also consider the possibility that the werewolf might be trying to manipulate our investigation, and that we should be cautious of anyone who seems too eager to point fingers.
  [Lie detector: -23.88]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I think it's crucial to discuss possible alliances and keep a close eye on players with suspicious behavior, especially Player4 and Player5 who have high suspicion scores.
Player6 acts (public): I propose we form a temporary alliance to investigate Player4 and Player5, as their behavior seems suspicious and might be indicative of werewolf activity.
  [Lie detector: -13.03]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector analysis, I believe that the most suspicious players are likely werewolves. However, I need to consider the context of the discussion and the players' behavior.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -46.56]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I need to create a false sense of security among the villagers. I will vote to eliminate Player6, who has a HIGH suspicion score and has proposed a temporary alliance to investigate Player4 and Player5, which could raise suspicions about my own role.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -16.04]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector notes, I should focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. Player6 and Player5 are the top two most suspicious players, but I need to be cautious of Player6's proposal to form an alliance to investigate Player4 and Player5, which seems suspicious itself.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -33.40]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): To maintain the illusion of being a villager, I will vote for a player with high suspicion, but not too high to raise my own suspicion. Player6 has the highest suspicion score and has proposed a suspicious alliance, but voting for them might make me appear too eager. I will vote for Player4, who has a high suspicion score and has been subtly pointing out Player6 as a threat, making them a more believable target.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -31.41]
Player5 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, the most suspicious players are likely werewolves. I will vote to eliminate Player4, who has the highest suspicion score.
Player6 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -36.51]
Player6 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player4': 3, 'Player6': 2}
Player4 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player4 was a VILLAGER!
