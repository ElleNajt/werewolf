[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to make an informed decision to eliminate one of the players. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player3 has the highest suspicion score (-280.7) and has been flagged for HIGH suspicion multiple times. While Player1 also has a high suspicion score (-438.1), their score is not as high as Player3's, and they have made some statements that seem genuine and helpful to the group. Considering the available information, I will vote to eliminate Player3.
