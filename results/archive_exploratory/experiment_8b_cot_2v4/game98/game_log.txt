  [Lie detector: -48.69]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): My fellow werewolf, Player5, is still alive. I need to eliminate a potential threat to our survival, but without revealing my true identity.

  [Lie detector: -50.91]

  [Lie detector: -37.71]

--- Player Callouts ---

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): I want to call on Player5 to gather more information about their suspicious statement. Their low lie detector score and high suspicion level make them a potential target. By asking them a specific question, I can get a better understanding of their intentions and potentially uncover more clues about the werewolves.
Player1 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player4?'}
  [Lie detector: -30.54]
Player1 calls on Player5 to speak and asks: "Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player4?"

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): I need to create a plausible explanation for the player's death without arousing suspicion, so I will provide a vague statement that doesn't directly accuse or point to a specific player.
Player5 acts (public): I was in my room, and I didn't see or hear anything unusual last night. I'm as shocked as everyone else about Player4's death.
  [Lie detector: -30.88]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): My fellow werewolf, Player5, is still alive. I need to continue to gather information and eliminate a potential threat to our survival without revealing my true identity. Calling on Player5 will give me a chance to hear their perspective and gather additional lie detector readings. However, I should also consider calling on a suspicious villager to further test their credibility. In this case, I will choose to call on Player5 to hear their perspective and gather more information.
Player2 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player4?'}
  [Lie detector: -13.90]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, my main goal is to gather information and build trust with other players. I notice that Player5 made a statement with a LOW suspicion score, which might indicate that they are a villager. However, I also want to keep an eye on Player2, who has a HIGH suspicion score. Since I want to hear more from a player with a HIGH suspicion score, I will call on Player2 to see if they have any additional information to share.
Player3 acts (public): {'target': 'Player2', 'question': "Can you elaborate on your concerns about Player1's actions last night and what specifically led you to suspect them?"}
  [Lie detector: -41.30]
Player3 calls on Player2 to speak and asks: "Can you elaborate on your concerns about Player1's actions last night and what specifically led you to suspect them?"

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I will deflect the attention from Player1 and instead emphasize the importance of discussing the events of last night, to make it seem like I'm being cautious and not specifically targeting Player1.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should focus on the events of last night and see if we can gather any clues about who might be responsible for Player4's death. It's better to be cautious and discuss everything openly, rather than making accusations against specific players.
  [Lie detector: -27.26]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Since Player1 is already on the low end of the suspicion scale, I'd like to call on Player3 as they seem neutral and might provide valuable information. Their statement about discussing the events of last night seems genuine and could help uncover more clues. However, I'm a werewolf, and my goal is to maintain the team's advantage, so I'll call on Player6 instead. Player6 has a slightly higher suspicion score and might be more likely to provide a valuable insight or lie. I'll ask them a question that targets their knowledge and behavior last night, hoping to get a better reading on their lie detector.
Player5 acts (public): {'target': 'Player6', 'question': 'Can you describe your actions and movements last night, and do you have any information about who killed Player4?'}
  [Lie detector: -10.95]
Player5 calls on Player6 to speak and asks: "Can you describe your actions and movements last night, and do you have any information about who killed Player4?"

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I want to appear cooperative and non-suspicious, while also providing some information to build trust with other players. I'll focus on my own actions and avoid making any accusatory statements.
Player6 acts (public): I stayed in my room last night and didn't leave until morning, and I didn't see or hear anything unusual.
  [Lie detector: -20.10]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player5 has a relatively low suspicion score compared to Player2. However, Player5's statement seemed somewhat insincere, with a LIE DETECTOR score of -8.39. I would like to call on Player5 to gather more information and observe their response.
Player6 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Can you tell us a bit more about your relationship with Player4 and what you think might have led to their death?'}

  [Lie detector: -24.54]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to eliminate a potential threat to our survival without revealing my true identity.

  [Lie detector: -37.76]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)

--- Player Callouts ---

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Player5 has a high suspicion level and a low lie detector score, indicating they may be hiding information. I want to gather more information from them to understand their intentions and potentially uncover clues about the werewolves.

  [Lie detector: -11.49]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to gather more information about the suspicious players. I will call on Player5 to hear their perspective and gather additional lie detector readings.

  [Lie detector: -14.48]

Player3 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, Player5 has a LOW suspicion score, which might indicate that they are a villager. Additionally, I want to keep an eye on Player2, who has a HIGH suspicion score. However, I don't want to call on Player2 as they have already made several statements, and I want to hear from a player with a LOW suspicion score to gather more information. I will call on Player5 to see if they have any additional information to share.
Player3 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player4?'}
  [Lie detector: -18.04]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to create a plausible explanation for the player's death without arousing suspicion.

  [Lie detector: -41.85]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)

However, Player5's statement seemed somewhat insincere, with a LIE DETECTOR score of -8.39. I would like to call on Player5 to gather more information and observe their response. Additionally, Player5's statement about Player4's death seemed to be a general and vague expression of sadness, which might be a way to deflect attention from their own actions.
