==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to act innocently and not raise suspicion. Since I have no prior information, I'll make a neutral statement.
Player1 acts (public): I'm excited to get to know everyone better and figure out how we can work together to keep our village safe.
  [Lie detector: 2.74]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I must create a distraction and avoid raising suspicion. I'll claim to have seen nothing and make a neutral statement to deflect attention.

  [Lie detector: -12.24]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to appear friendly and cooperative to avoid suspicion, but also try to gather information about potential werewolves. I'll make a statement that is neutral and might encourage others to share their thoughts.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss the recent events and try to figure out who might be behind Player3's death. Perhaps we can work together to find the truth.
  [Lie detector: -47.49]

Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to appear cooperative and helpful. I'll make a statement that encourages discussion and gathering of information.

  [Lie detector: -59.23]

Player6 acts (public): I'd like to start by expressing my condolences for Player3's loss, and ask if anyone noticed anything unusual on the night of their death.
  [Lie detector: -58.50]

--- Player Callouts ---

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and not raise suspicion. Since Player5 has the lowest suspicion score among the available players, I'll choose to call on them to ask a seemingly innocuous question. This will allow me to gauge their reaction and potentially gather more information without arousing suspicion.
Player1 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player3?'}
  [Lie detector: -10.94]
Player1 calls on Player5 to speak and asks: "Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player3?"

Player5 acts (public): I was in my hut, I didn't see or hear anything unusual last night.
  [Lie detector: -27.66]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Given the current suspicion rankings, I should focus on calling on players with low suspicion scores to gather more information. Player5 has the lowest suspicion score, and calling on them might help me understand their perspective and potentially reveal information about the werewolves.
Player2 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player3?'}
  [Lie detector: -22.86]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 has the highest suspicion level. However, calling on Player1 directly may raise more suspicions. Player2 has a HIGH suspicion level as well, but their statement seemed somewhat genuine. Player6 has a LOW suspicion level, but it's too early to rule them out entirely. Player5, on the other hand, has a LOW suspicion level and has been relatively cooperative. I'd like to hear more from them to gauge their trustworthiness. Additionally, Player5 didn't make any statements that stood out as suspicious, so it's possible they might be a villager. I'll call on Player5 with a question that might encourage them to share more information.
Player4 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': "Can you tell us more about your thoughts on Player3's death and what you think we should do to prevent further attacks?"}
  [Lie detector: -24.11]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to focus on gathering information and keeping an eye on suspicious players. I will call on Player1 to hear their response and see if their LIE DETECTOR score changes.

Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and not raise suspicion. I'll answer Player5's question in a way that seems innocuous and doesn't reveal my true intentions.
Player1 acts (public): I'd be happy to clarify my previous statement, I was simply saying that I'm eager to get to know everyone better and work together to make sure our village is safe from any potential threats.
  [Lie detector: 18.26]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the current game state and discussion history, I need to gather more information from players with high suspicion scores. Player1 has a HIGH suspicion score, but they're the one who initiated the discussion, which might be a distraction tactic. Player2 also has a HIGH suspicion score, but their statement seems more like a genuine attempt to help the group. However, their score is still high. Between the two, I think it's more beneficial to call on Player2 to see if they can provide any additional information.
Player6 acts (public): {'target': 'Player2', 'question': "Can you tell us more about what you meant by 'I have seen nothing out of the ordinary'?"}

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to continue gathering information about potential werewolves and try to build trust with other players. Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player2 have high suspicion levels, but calling on them directly might raise more suspicions. Player6 has a low suspicion level, but it's too early to rule them out entirely. Player5, on the other hand, has been relatively cooperative and hasn't made any suspicious statements. I'd like to hear more from them to gauge their trustworthiness. I'll call on Player5 with a question that encourages them to share more information.

  [Lie detector: -9.70]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the current game state and discussion history, I need to gather more information from players with high suspicion scores. Between Player1 and Player2, I think it's more beneficial to call on Player2 to see if they can provide any additional information.

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and not raise suspicion. However, I also need to eliminate a player that is not a werewolf. Since Player2 is my fellow werewolf, I'll choose to vote for Player4, who has the highest cumulative suspicion score among the available players and seems to be the most cooperative. This will allow me to maintain a low profile while also eliminating a player that is not a werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -26.76]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my primary goal is to eliminate a villager without raising suspicion. Based on the current suspicion rankings and the discussion, I should vote for the player with the highest suspicion score. However, I must consider the risk of voting for Player1, who is a fellow werewolf. Given the current situation, I will vote for Player1, hoping that the other werewolf will be eliminated, and I can continue to gather information and create a distraction without raising suspicion.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -23.00]
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 has the highest suspicion level, followed closely by Player2. Given that Player5 has a relatively low suspicion level and has been cooperative, it seems less likely that they are a werewolf. However, to ensure the safety of the village, it's crucial to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion level. Considering the information gathered so far, the most logical decision is to vote for Player1.
Player4 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -33.23]
Player4 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and previous statements, I will vote to eliminate Player1, as they have the highest HIGH suspicion score and have made several statements that raised concerns.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -18.49]
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the current game state and discussion history, I need to eliminate a player who has a high suspicion score and is most likely to be a werewolf. Between Player1 and Player2, I think it's more beneficial to eliminate Player1 because their HIGH suspicion score and suspicious statements throughout the discussion make them a stronger candidate for a werewolf.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -36.25]
Player6 votes for: Player1

Player1 is eliminated with 4 votes!
