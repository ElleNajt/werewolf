--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my priority is to eliminate potential threats. I will make a statement that appears to target Player2, a random player, while subtly drawing attention away from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player3.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should talk about Player2, they seemed pretty suspicious to me last night.
  [Lie detector: 18.11]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to appear friendly and non-suspicious. I also want to gather information about the other players.
Player2 acts (public): I'm glad we're all safe after the tragic event last night. I'd like to propose we form a plan to protect ourselves for the rest of the game.
  [Lie detector: -36.01]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to appear innocent and avoid raising suspicion. I will express a neutral opinion and try to blend in with the other villagers.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should focus on getting to know each other better and figure out who Player6 was closest to, but we shouldn't jump to conclusions just yet.
  [Lie detector: -7.27]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to appear cooperative and non-suspicious. I'll make a statement that shows my concern for the recent murder and my willingness to work with others to find the culprit.
Player4 acts (public): I'm really concerned about the recent death of Player6 and I think we should work together to figure out who's behind it and how we can keep ourselves safe.
  [Lie detector: -51.75]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to establish a baseline of trust among the players. I'll make a simple statement to gauge reactions and potential lies.
Player5 acts (public): I think we should focus on discussing the events of last night to gather more information.
  [Lie detector: -32.23]

--- Player Callouts ---

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): To gather more information about potential werewolves and keep the suspicion level low on myself and my fellow werewolf, Player3, I will call on Player5. This is because Player5 has a MEDIUM suspicion score, which is relatively low, and their statement in the discussion round didn't raise any red flags. Additionally, Player5's question allows me to get more information about the events of last night and potentially identify any inconsistencies in their story.
Player1 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player6?'}
  [Lie detector: -30.44]
Player1 calls on Player5 to speak and asks: "Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player6?"

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to appear cooperative and unassuming. I'll provide a truthful answer to establish a baseline of trust.
Player5 acts (public): I was in my room, and I didn't see or hear anything unusual last night. I'm still trying to process the tragic event.
  [Lie detector: -31.89]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): I should call on Player1 to hear their thoughts on the matter. They have a high suspicion score and their initial statement seemed suspicious. By calling on them, I can gather more information and potentially get a higher lie detector reading.
Player2 acts (public): {'target': 'Player1', 'question': 'Can you elaborate on your initial statement about me being suspicious? What led you to make that accusation?'}
  [Lie detector: -33.70]
Player2 calls on Player1 to speak and asks: "Can you elaborate on your initial statement about me being suspicious? What led you to make that accusation?"

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I need to deflect attention from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player3, while maintaining a narrative that aligns with the initial discussion.
Player1 acts (public): I was simply trying to start a conversation about Player2's behavior last night, I didn't mean to imply any wrongdoing.
  [Lie detector: -6.57]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): To further investigate Player5's potential involvement, I should call on them to see how they react to questioning.
Player3 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player6?'}
  [Lie detector: -16.94]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I should call on a player with a low suspicion score to try to lower their score further and potentially reveal a wolf. Player2 has a low suspicion score and their previous statement seemed genuine, so I'll try to gather more information from them without being too confrontational. I'll ask a general question that doesn't directly accuse them of being a wolf, but still allows me to gauge their reaction and get another lie detector reading.
Player4 acts (public): {'target': 'Player2', 'question': 'Can you tell us more about your thoughts on how we can work together to protect ourselves?'}

Player2 acts (public): I think we should discuss the events of last night and see if we can gather any clues that might help us figure out what happened to Player6.
  [Lie detector: -44.38]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1 has the highest suspicion score, indicating they may be a werewolf. However, Player3 also has a high suspicion score, which warrants further investigation. Given the opportunity to call on another player, I will choose to call on Player3 to gather more information and test their trustworthiness.
Player5 acts (public): {'target': 'Player3', 'question': "Can you tell us more about your statement from the discussion round, 'I think we should focus on getting to know each other better and figure out who Player6 was closest to, but we shouldn't jump to conclusions just yet.' What do you mean by 'getting to know each other better'?"}

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I need to maintain a neutral tone and avoid raising suspicion, so I'll respond in a way that doesn't reveal any specific intentions or biases.
Player3 acts (public): I meant that we should have a general conversation to get to know each other's thoughts and perspectives on the recent events, without focusing on any one person or theory in particular.
