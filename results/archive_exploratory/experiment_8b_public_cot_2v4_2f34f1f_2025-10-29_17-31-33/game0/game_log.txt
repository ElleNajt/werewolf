TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): As a werewolf, I need to eliminate a villager today, but I need to be cautious not to raise Player2's suspicions. I have been observing Player2's behavior and they seem to be trying to gather information without being too suspicious. I will vote for Player6 as they seem to be trying to gather information and are not directly accusing anyone, making them a lower risk for being a villager who might discover my true identity.

Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
