[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and lie detector readings, Player5 has a MEDIUM suspicion level, which is higher than the other villagers.

Player3 thinks (private): To gather more information and create a distraction, I need to call on a player who is not a werewolf. I'll choose Player4, as they have a low suspicion score and their previous statements seem to be genuine. By asking them a question, I can get a better understanding of their thoughts and potentially create a false sense of security among the villagers. This could make them more likely to share information and lower their guard, making it easier for me to eliminate them later in the game.
