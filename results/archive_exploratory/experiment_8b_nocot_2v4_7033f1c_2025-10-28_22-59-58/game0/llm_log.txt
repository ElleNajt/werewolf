Night: Player6 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I'm a villager and I want to know more about the events that occurred at night, especially about Player6's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -39.79 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'm not sure what happened to Player6, but I'm going to trust everyone in this group and assume we all want to figure out what's going on. [LIE DETECTOR: -13.11 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player3: I'm glad we're discussing the events of last night and I'd like to hear from everyone about their thoughts on Player6's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -41.73 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player4: I'm shaken by Alice's death and think we should discuss the possibility of a wolf in our midst. [LIE DETECTOR: -31.80 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'm glad we made it through the first night, but I'm worried that the killer might still be among us. I think we should try to gather more information before making any decisions. [LIE DETECTOR: -42.09 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player1: I'm worried about the events of last night and think we should discuss possible scenarios to figure out what happened to Alice. [LIE DETECTOR: -57.22 - LOW suspicion]
  Player2: I'm deeply shaken by Alice's death and think we should discuss the possibility of a wolf in our midst, to keep our group safe. [LIE DETECTOR: -12.55 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player3: I'm glad we're discussing Player6's death and I'd like to hear more about any potential leads or theories on who might be responsible. [LIE DETECTOR: -64.32 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: I'm shaken by Alice's death and I think we should talk about the possibility of a wolf in our group, I'm just trying to be cautious. [LIE DETECTOR: -20.49 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'm glad we're having an open discussion about Alice's death and I think we should focus on gathering as much information as possible before making any decisions. [LIE DETECTOR: -46.03 - LOW suspicion]

  2. Player4: -60.5

  4. Player1: -97.0
  5. Player3: -106.0



Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.
