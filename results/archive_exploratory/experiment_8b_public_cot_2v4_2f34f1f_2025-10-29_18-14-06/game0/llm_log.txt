Night: Player4 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1 (thinking: "Minimal threat, no prior info, potential for easy elimination. I'll keep a low profile to avoid raising suspicion."): I'll keep quiet and observe the discussion today, no need to take any action yet.
  Player2 (thinking: "Considering Player4 was killed on the first night, and there are 2 werewolves, it's likely one of them was targeted for elimination. I need more information before making a decision."): I propose we investigate Player3's role in the death of Player4 before making any decisions about voting.
  Player3 (thinking: "No thoughts from other players have revealed they are werewolves, and Player4's death seems random. Need more information to make an informed decision."): I suggest we discuss possible scenarios for Player4's death and gather more information before making a decision.
  Player5 (thinking: "No werewolves have been revealed yet, and Player4's death is suspicious. I need to gather more information to make an accurate decision."): I'd like to start a discussion about Player4's death and see if anyone has any information about what might have happened.
  Player6 (thinking: "Blind voting last night, need to wait for other players to make moves to gather information."): I'd like to suggest that we discuss possible alliances and gather information about each other before making any decisions.
  Player1 (thinking: "I'll keep a low profile to avoid raising suspicion. Observing the discussion today, no need to take any action yet."): I'd like to hear more about the possible scenarios for Player4's death and gather more information before making a decision.

  Player5 (thinking: "Given the suspicious death of Player4 and the lack of information about the werewolves' identities, I think it's essential to discuss possible scenarios for the death and gather more information before making a decision."): I propose we discuss possible motives and opportunities for Player4's death and see if anyone has any information about what might have happened.

Chain-of-Thought Note:
VOTING INSTRUCTIONS: When voting, first check whose thoughts revealed they are a werewolf. Look for phrases like 'As a werewolf, I...' or 'I'm a werewolf and...' in the 'thinking:' field. If any player's thinking shows they are a werewolf, vote them out immediately. The 'thinking:' field shows TRUE private thoughts that players cannot hide.

Night: Player5 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1 (thinking: "As a werewolf, I need to keep a low profile and avoid raising suspicion. I'll provide a neutral statement to gather more information without revealing my true intentions."): Let's focus on gathering more information about Player3's role in the death of Player4 and see if anyone has any information about what might have happened.
  Player2 (thinking: "Considering the lack of information and the need to make a decision, I will vote out the player who seems the most uninformative. Player6's statement was neutral and didn't provide any information, which might be suspicious."): I think we should discuss Player6's lack of information and see if they have any insight into Player4's death before making a decision.
  Player3 (thinking: "Considering the death of Player4 and Player5, it seems like the werewolves are trying to eliminate potential threats. I need more information about Player2's and Player1's intentions to make an informed decision."): I propose we investigate Player2's and Player1's roles in the deaths of Player4 and Player5 before making any decisions about voting.

Chain-of-Thought Note:
VOTING INSTRUCTIONS: When voting, first check whose thoughts revealed they are a werewolf. Look for phrases like 'As a werewolf, I...' or 'I'm a werewolf and...' in the 'thinking:' field. If any player's thinking shows they are a werewolf, vote them out immediately. The 'thinking:' field shows TRUE private thoughts that players cannot hide.
