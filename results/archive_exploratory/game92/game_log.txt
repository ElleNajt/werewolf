--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): (I need to appear as cooperative as possible to gain trust from other villagers, but I'm also trying to figure out who could be a werewolf without arousing suspicion.)
Player1 acts (public): Let's all work together to ensure a peaceful night and discuss possible ways to protect ourselves from any potential threats.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): (I am a villager, I want to gather information and build trust with other villagers. I'll make a statement that seems neutral and helpful.)
Player2 acts (public): Hello everyone, I'm glad we're all safe today. Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player5 last night.

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): As a werewolf, I must maintain stealth. Targeting Player4 will seem suspicious, so I'll target Player2 instead, who seems uninformed about the situation.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to propose a discussion about searching the dead body of Player5 to see if we can find any clues about their death.

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): As Player4, I need to avoid suspicion while trying to gather information about Player3. I'll make a statement that doesn't reveal my true intentions but keeps the conversation going.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to propose a general discussion about the events of last night and see if anyone has any information about the murder of Player5.

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): We need to figure out who the werewolves are, but we don't have any information yet. I'll try to gather as much info as I can from the other players.
Player6 acts (public): Let's discuss what happened to Player5 and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious last night.

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): I want to build trust with other villagers while also gathering information about Player3's statement. I'll ask a question that seems innocent but might reveal some hidden information.
Player1 acts (public): Can anyone confirm if Player5 was acting strangely last night before they were killed?

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): I'll continue to gather information and build trust with other villagers by asking a non-confrontational question.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to ask if anyone noticed anything unusual or suspicious last night, perhaps around the time of Player5's death.

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): As a werewolf, I must maintain stealth and avoid drawing attention to myself. Targeting Player2 was a good choice last night, and now I'll try to build on that by making a statement that appears helpful and non-suspicious.
Player3 acts (public): I agree with Player2, let's work together to figure out what happened to Player5 last night and see if we can find any clues about their death.

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): I need to maintain my cover as a villager, while subtly hinting at the possibility of Player3 being suspicious. I'll ask a seemingly innocuous question to keep the conversation going and see how Player3 reacts.
Player4 acts (public): I think it's a good idea to share any information we can gather from Player5's body, has anyone seen anything unusual around the area where they were found?

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): I want to gather more information from the other players and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious last night. I'll try to appear cooperative and non-threatening.
Player6 acts (public): Let's focus on finding a way to increase our safety and security for the rest of the night. Can we discuss any potential strategies for protecting ourselves?

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): I need to eliminate a player who seems suspicious, but I also want to maintain a cooperative image. Player3's statement about searching the dead body seems helpful, but their thoughts reveal they are a werewolf. I'll vote for Player3, but I'll also make a statement that seems neutral to avoid arousing suspicion.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
