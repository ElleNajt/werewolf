TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player4 has the highest suspicion score among the options. As a villager, my goal is to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score to minimize the risk of a werewolf remaining in the game.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -38.04]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest cumulative suspicion score, which is Player1.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -21.65]
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to eliminate a player who is not a werewolf, while also avoiding drawing suspicion from the other werewolves. Player4 is my fellow werewolf and is not an option to eliminate. I will choose a player who has a low cumulative suspicion ranking, as they are less likely to be a werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -8.12]
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the Lie Detector scores and suspicion levels, it is clear that I must eliminate a player who is suspicious but not yet a target. Player3 has a high suspicion score and is a fellow werewolf, making them a target for elimination. However, Player1 also has a high suspicion score and has been cautious in their statements, making them a potential threat. Considering our shared goal as werewolves, I will vote to eliminate Player1.
Player4 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -21.31]
Player4 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, the highest suspicion players are Player1 and Player3, with scores of -60.9 and -62.2 respectively. However, considering the experimental nature of the lie detector and potential errors, I'll opt for a more cautious approach. Player4 has a lower cumulative suspicion score of -68.1, which is closer to Player1 and Player3, but still relatively high. Considering the goal of gaining trust and information, I'll vote for Player4, as they have a slightly lower cumulative suspicion score and might be more likely to be a villager.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
