Player1 acts (public): I propose we vote to kill Player2, as they were the last one to interact with the deceased Player3.

Player2 thinks (private): Since Player3 is dead, it's essential to figure out who might have killed them. I should focus on gathering information about each player's behavior and alibis.
Player2 acts (public): Let's start by discussing Player3's death and see if anyone has any information about what happened during the night.

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to start gathering information and build trust with other players. Since Player3 was killed, it's essential to discuss potential motives and alliances.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should start by asking if anyone saw or heard anything unusual last night, and if they have any information about Player3's death.

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Preserve teammate and gain information, I will try to make a statement that seems innocent but might gather information about the other players.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to propose a general discussion about the events of last night, maybe someone noticed something suspicious?

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I should try to gain information about the other players and their possible roles. I'll make a statement that doesn't give away too much but encourages discussion.
Player6 acts (public): Let's discuss the recent death of Player3. Was it a wolf attack or a villager mistake?
