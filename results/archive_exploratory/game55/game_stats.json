However, Player6 has already been eliminated in the previous turn. Given the sudden death of Player5, who had a low suspicion level, it's difficult to determine their trustworthiness. To identify a potential werewolf, I'll focus on the remaining players with high suspicion levels. Player1 and Player10 have medium to high suspicion levels, but their involvement in the discussion is less prominent compared to the other players. Player4 has a medium suspicion level, but their earlier statement about keeping an open mind and not jumping to conclusions suggests they may be a villager. Given the current situation, I think it's essential to focus on eliminating a player with a high suspicion level. I'll choose Player1 as the target for elimination.\",\n  \"action\": \"Player1\"\n}",
