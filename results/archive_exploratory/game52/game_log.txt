Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: 6.63]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)

--- Discussion Round 1/3 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information and assess potential threats. I'll start by making a statement that encourages others to share their knowledge and thoughts.
Player1 acts (public): I've noticed that Player3 passed away last night, and I'm concerned about the safety of our group. Has anyone seen or heard anything suspicious?
  [Lie detector: -66.90]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to appear friendly and gain trust from the group. I will make a statement that seems innocuous and encourages collaboration.
Player2 acts (public): Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player3. Maybe we can share any information we have about the events of the previous night.
  [Lie detector: -44.81]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to maintain a balance between being suspicious and not arousing too much attention. I'll make a statement that's neither too revealing nor too defensive.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we start by discussing the events of last night, but let's also be cautious not to jump to conclusions. We don't know who might be involved.
  [Lie detector: -41.75]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I need to appear innocent and gain the trust of the other villagers. I will make a statement that seems concerned about the recent death but also tries to shift the focus away from potential werewolves.
Player5 acts (public): I'm really worried about the recent death of Player3, but I think we should focus on finding the cause rather than jumping to conclusions.
  [Lie detector: -46.25]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to appear non-threatening and gather information without arousing suspicion. I'll target Player1, who seems neutral and hasn't made any bold claims, and try to steer the conversation towards them.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to ask Player1 about their plans for the game, to gauge their intentions and see how they react to scrutiny.
