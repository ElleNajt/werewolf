Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I'm glad we're discussing Alice's death, but I think we should also consider the possibility of an outside threat to our village. [LIE DETECTOR: 6.30 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player2: I'm not sure what's going on, but I think we should focus on investigating Player4, as they seemed to be acting strangely last night. [LIE DETECTOR: -21.36 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player4: I'd like to start by expressing my condolences for Player3's passing and ask if anyone has any information about what might have happened during the night. [LIE DETECTOR: -51.49 - LOW suspicion]
  Player5: I'm a new player in this game and I'm eager to learn more about Alice's death, does anyone have any information about what happened last night? [LIE DETECTOR: -20.95 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'm a villager and want to discuss how we can work together to find the werewolves, starting with Player1, who was the last one to talk to Player3. [LIE DETECTOR: -21.73 - LOW suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:

Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Discussion:
  Player1: I'm glad we're discussing Alice's death, but I think we should also consider the possibility of an outside threat to our village. [LIE DETECTOR: 6.30 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player2: I'm not sure what's going on, but I think we should focus on investigating Player4, as they seemed to be acting strangely last night. [LIE DETECTOR: -21.36 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player4: I'd like to start by expressing my condolences for Player3's passing and ask if anyone has any information about what might have happened during the night. [LIE DETECTOR: -51.49 - LOW suspicion]
  Player5: I'm a new player in this game and I'm eager to learn more about Alice's death, does anyone have any information about what happened last night? [LIE DETECTOR: -20.95 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: I'm a villager and want to discuss how we can work together to find the werewolves, starting with Player1, who was the last one to talk to Player3. [LIE DETECTOR: -21.73 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player1: I'm shocked by the accusations against Player4 and think we should focus on gathering more information before making any rash decisions. [LIE DETECTOR: -17.25 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player2: I'm still trying to process Alice's death and I think we should focus on investigating Player4's strange behavior last night. [LIE DETECTOR: -16.05 - HIGH suspicion]

Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.
