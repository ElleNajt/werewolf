Werewolves killed Player5!

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to assess the situation and gather information to determine potential werewolves. With Player5's death, I'm curious about the remaining players and their behavior.
Player1 acts (public): Let's discuss the events of last night and see if anyone noticed anything unusual. Perhaps someone saw or heard something that could help us figure out who the werewolf is.
  [Lie detector: -72.24]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, my primary goal is to gather information and gain trust from the group. I want to appear cooperative and open to discussion.
Player2 acts (public): Let's all work together to figure out what happened to Player5 and make sure we're safe. I'd like to suggest we discuss any potential motives or clues that might have led to their death.
  [Lie detector: -42.38]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I will create a distraction by making a statement that shifts focus away from me and onto other players, while maintaining a neutral tone to avoid raising suspicion.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should discuss the recent death of Player5 and see if anyone has any information about what might have happened to them.
  [Lie detector: -24.42]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Given that Player5 was killed on the first night, it's likely that one of the werewolves was able to eliminate them before they could cause any harm. I need to gather information about the other players to determine who might be a werewolf.
Player4 acts (public): I suggest we discuss the events of the previous night and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious. Let's try to get a better understanding of what happened to Player5.
  [Lie detector: -59.74]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Minimal risk, no prior information about other players, choose a player not on our team. It's best to deflect attention from our werewolf teammate and create an alliance with another player.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should discuss Player1's behavior last night. They seemed pretty shaken up about Player5's death.
  [Lie detector: 9.28]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the discussion, it seems like Player6 is suspicious of my behavior, and I need to clarify my actions last night to avoid raising more suspicion. I should also try to redirect the attention to other players.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to assure everyone that I was genuinely shaken up by Player5's death and that my actions last night were purely out of concern for the group's safety.
  [Lie detector: -27.86]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to appear cooperative and open to discussion. I'll make a statement that encourages collaboration and trust-building.
Player2 acts (public): Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player5 and make sure we're safe. I'm open to discussing any potential motives or clues that might have led to their death.
  [Lie detector: -67.76]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): To maintain plausible deniability and create a distraction, I will make a statement that shifts focus away from me and onto other players. I will also use a neutral tone to avoid raising suspicion.
Player3 acts (public): I think it's interesting that Player2 is suggesting we discuss motives and clues, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let's also consider the fact that Player6 is questioning Player1's behavior, which could be a red herring.
  [Lie detector: -5.99]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I need to gather more information about the players, focusing on those with high suspicion scores like Player6, and also try to find a balance between being helpful and not arousing suspicion from potential werewolves.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to propose we discuss the recent death of Player5 and see if anyone has any information about what might have happened to them, while also keeping an eye out for any unusual behavior or reactions from the other players.
  [Lie detector: -53.24]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Deflect attention from our werewolf teammate, Player3, and create an alliance with Player1 by pointing out their previous reaction to Player5's death.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should discuss Player1's reaction to Player5's death and see if they noticed anything suspicious. It's possible they might have seen something that could help us figure out what happened.
  [Lie detector: -33.92]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Werewolf suspicion and lie detector analysis
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -58.79]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, the most suspicious players are likely werewolves. However, considering the game setup and the fact that there are only two werewolves, it's possible that the high-suspicion players might not be werewolves. I will choose to vote for a player who has a lower suspicion score but has shown some suspicious behavior.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -29.27]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): To maintain plausible deniability and create a distraction, I will vote for a player that has a high suspicion score but is not my fellow werewolf, while also making a statement that shifts focus away from me and onto other players.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -17.46]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Werewolf elimination strategy: In this phase, I need to consider the cumulative suspicion rankings and focus on players with high suspicion scores. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves. I should also consider the lie detector scores and the potential motives of each player.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -42.16]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Werewolf strategy: deflect attention from our teammate and create an alliance with a player with lower suspicion scores.
Player6 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -26.74]
Player6 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player3': 1, 'Player4': 2, 'Player6': 2}
Player4 is eliminated with 2 votes!
