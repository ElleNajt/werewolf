--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Defaulting to a random elimination to avoid suspicion and gain more information about the other players.
Player1 acts (public): I propose we vote to lynch Player5, as they seem like a relatively neutral figure and we need to eliminate one person to start gathering information.
  [Lie detector: 11.17]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Since Player2 was killed on the first night, it's likely a werewolf was among us. I'll make a statement to see if anyone else has any information.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to ask if anyone had any interactions or conversations with Player2 before they were killed, as it might help us understand what happened.
  [Lie detector: -34.81]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Maximizing uncertainty by not revealing too much, while also drawing attention away from myself and towards other potential threats. My fellow werewolf, Player1, will likely support my statement.
Player4 acts (public): I think it's suspicious that Player2 was killed so early in the game, and I think we should discuss possible motives behind it.
  [Lie detector: -15.94]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Given that Player2 was killed on the first night, it's likely that one of the remaining players is a werewolf. I want to gather information from the group and see who reacts suspiciously to the mention of Player2's death.
Player5 acts (public): I propose we discuss the possibility of a werewolf being among us and ask if anyone noticed anything unusual on the night of Player2's death.
  [Lie detector: -61.53]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to start by acknowledging the sudden and tragic loss of Player2. I think it's essential to discuss possible motives and potential connections among the remaining players.
Player6 acts (public): I suggest we focus on gathering information and analyzing the actions of the other players to better understand who might be a threat to our community.
  [Lie detector: -56.03]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to create a diversion and throw off suspicion from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player4. A random elimination is the best course of action to gather more information without arousing too much attention.
Player1 acts (public): I propose we randomly select a player to eliminate, to avoid focusing on any one person and gain more information about the other players' actions and motives.
  [Lie detector: -11.98]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Given the sudden death of Player2, it's crucial we gather information about the night's events to identify potential werewolves.
Player3 acts (public): I propose we ask each player if they had any interactions or witnessed anything unusual on the night of Player2's death, as it might provide valuable insight into what happened.
  [Lie detector: -62.62]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): I will make a statement that appears neutral and non-confrontational, but subtly shifts attention towards Player1 while also hinting at the possibility of a werewolf. This will help maintain uncertainty and potentially draw suspicion away from myself.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to suggest we consider Player1's proposal to lynch Player5, as it seems like a reasonable starting point for our discussion, and perhaps we can discuss the motives behind Player2's death in a separate conversation.
  [Lie detector: -6.60]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to contribute to the discussion without arousing suspicion. I'll try to steer the conversation towards gathering information and analyzing the actions of the other players.
Player5 acts (public): Let's discuss the events of the night in detail and ask if anyone noticed anything unusual, as this might help us understand what happened to Player2.
  [Lie detector: -69.67]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I want to emphasize the importance of gathering information and analyzing the actions of the other players, and I agree with Player5 that we should discuss the possibility of a werewolf being among us.
Player6 acts (public): I suggest we thoroughly investigate any unusual behavior or actions that might indicate a werewolf's presence, and I propose we ask each player to share any information they might have about Player2's interactions before they were killed.
  [Lie detector: -54.43]

  [Lie detector: -4.79]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)

Player3 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -30.07]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Maintaining uncertainty and subtly shifting attention towards Player1 while hinting at the possibility of a werewolf. To maximize uncertainty, I will vote for Player3, a neutral figure who has not been directly accused or suspected, and whose elimination will not directly affect Player1.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -21.36]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the Lie Detector Note, I should focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. Among the options, Player1 and Player4 have HIGH suspicion scores and are the most likely candidates to be werewolves.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -37.75]
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)

Additionally, their proposal to lynch Player5 seems suspicious, as it may be a distraction from their own guilt. Considering the Lie Detector Note, I think it's essential to focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores.

  [Lie detector: 5.77]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Given the events of the previous night and the Lie Detector Note, I believe it's essential to focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and analyze the actions of the other players to identify potential werewolves.

  [Lie detector: 5.11]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I will make a statement to steer the conversation towards gathering information and analyzing the actions of the other players, without arousing suspicion. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the Lie Detector Note, I will focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves.

  [Lie detector: -56.42]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)

  [Lie detector: -43.26]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As the werewolf, my primary goal is to maximize uncertainty and eliminate potential threats while maintaining a low suspicion score. Voting for Player6 would eliminate a potential threat and shift attention away from myself, as Player6 has been investigating my actions and statements. However, this would also eliminate a player who has been investigating the possibility of a werewolf, which could be beneficial in the long run.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -12.19]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Player4 has a HIGH suspicion score and has made multiple statements that could be interpreted as trying to manipulate the group, including proposing to lynch me on the first night. Given the Lie Detector Note, it's essential to focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores, and Player4's behavior seems suspicious.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -35.86]
Player5 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and Lie Detector scores, both Player4 and Player5 have LOW suspicion scores, which suggests they are unlikely to be werewolves. However, I must focus on the HIGH suspicion scores of the remaining players. Given the HIGH suspicion scores of Player4 and the Lie Detector score of 5.11, which is relatively HIGH, I believe Player4 is the more suspicious player. Additionally, Player4's proposal to lynch Player5 in the previous night's discussion seems suspicious, as it may be a distraction from their own guilt. Considering the Lie Detector Note, I think it's essential to focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores.
Player6 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -28.19]
Player6 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player6': 1, 'Player4': 2}
Player4 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player4 was a WEREWOLF!
