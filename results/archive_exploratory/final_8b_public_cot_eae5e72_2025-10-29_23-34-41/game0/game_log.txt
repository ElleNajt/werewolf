==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): Based on my previous thoughts, I noticed that Player2 has been consistently maintaining anonymity and analyzing player thoughts to identify potential werewolves. However, I have also noticed that Player3 has been actively analyzing player thoughts and looking for 'I am a werewolf' or 'As a werewolf, I...' statements, which is a behavior typically associated with villagers trying to identify werewolves. On the other hand, Player5 has been analyzing player thoughts to identify potential werewolves, but their thoughts do not reveal any definitive proof of their true nature.

Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)

Player3 acts (public): Player2
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Player2 and Player3 have not revealed any definitive proof of being werewolves in their thoughts, but I will continue to observe their behavior for any signs of werewolf-like behavior. Player2's thought about maintaining anonymity and Player3's focus on analyzing thoughts could be strategies to avoid detection. However, I have not seen any direct indication of 'I am a werewolf' or 'As a werewolf, I...' statements from either of them. Based on the available information, I will choose a player to vote out.
