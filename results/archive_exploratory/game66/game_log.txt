TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I need to create a distraction and throw suspicion off me, but I also need to get a feel for the other players' thoughts. I'll make a statement that is somewhat cryptic and non-committal.
Player1 acts (public): I'm not sure what happened last night, but I'm glad we're all safe for now. Let's focus on finding out who might be behind Player3's death.
  [Lie detector: -39.20]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information and build trust. I'll start by making a statement that shows my good intentions and encourages others to share their thoughts.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss the events of last night and see if anyone has any information about who might have killed Player3. I'm open to hearing any theories or suspicions you may have.
  [Lie detector: -53.12]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to start gathering information and creating a sense of camaraderie among the living. I also want to subtly test the Lie Detector's accuracy.
Player4 acts (public): Hello everyone, I'm glad we made it through the first night. I'm eager to work together to figure out who might be a threat to our group.
  [Lie detector: -49.98]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gain information from other players without raising suspicion. I'll make a neutral statement to start the discussion.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to ask if anyone noticed anything unusual during the night when Player3 was killed.
  [Lie detector: -46.67]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): I need to maintain the balance of power in the game. Since Player1 is my fellow werewolf, I should make a statement that doesn't raise immediate suspicion, but also doesn't give away my identity or intentions.
Player6 acts (public): I propose that we focus on gathering more information about the deceased Player3 and the events of the previous night, rather than making any hasty accusations or decisions.
  [Lie detector: -19.05]

[Calling agent for Player7] (villager)
Player7 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to seem cooperative and build trust with other players. I'll start by asking for information and appearing concerned about the recent murder.
Player7 acts (public): I'm shocked to hear about Player3's death. Can we discuss what we know about the events of last night and share any information we might have?
  [Lie detector: -45.04]

--- Player Callouts ---

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player5 is currently ranked 3rd with a medium suspicion level. I'd like to hear more from them to gather additional information and potentially throw suspicion off myself. I'll ask a question that is somewhat accusatory but also open-ended, allowing Player5 to respond without directly incriminating themselves.
Player1 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player3?'}
  [Lie detector: -22.17]
Player1 calls on Player5 to speak and asks: "Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player3?"

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I want to maintain a neutral tone and avoid raising suspicion, so I'll provide a vague but honest account of my actions last night.
Player5 acts (public): I stayed in my bed and didn't leave my room last night, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual.
  [Lie detector: -30.64]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): I want to call on Player5 because they have a MEDIUM suspicion score, which is relatively high, and their question 'Did anyone notice anything unusual during the night when Player3 was killed?' suggests they might be trying to gather information. However, their suspicion score is not high enough to be immediately suspicious. By calling on them, I can get a better reading of their lie detector score and see if they have any information that might be useful to the group.
Player2 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'What did you think of Player3 before they were killed and do you have any theories about who might be a threat to our group?'}
  [Lie detector: -10.04]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)

Player4 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': "What did you do last night and do you have any information about Player3's death?"}
  [Lie detector: -20.33]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)

  [Lie detector: -27.65]
Player5 calls on Player6 to speak and asks: "Can you tell us more about your proposal to focus on gathering information about Player3, and do you have any theories about who might be behind their death?"

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): I need to maintain the balance of power in the game and avoid raising immediate suspicion. As my fellow werewolf, I should provide a statement that doesn't give away my identity or intentions.
Player6 acts (public): I think it's essential to gather as much information as possible about Player3's death, and I propose we discuss the events of last night, focusing on any potential witnesses or clues that might have been missed.
  [Lie detector: -34.27]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Since Player5 has a medium suspicion level, I think it would be beneficial to call on them to gather more information and see if they have any knowledge about the events of last night. Asking about their whereabouts and potential information about the killer could provide more insight into their potential involvement or knowledge of the werewolf's identity.
Player6 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player3?'}

Player4 thinks (private): Based on the Lie Detector's readings, Player6 and Player4 have the highest suspicion levels, but I'd like to call on Player5 to see if they have any new information or insights.
