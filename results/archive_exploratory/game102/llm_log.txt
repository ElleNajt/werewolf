=== GAME HISTORY ===

--- Turn 1 ---
Night: Player5 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1 (thinking: "As a villager, I need to gather information about the other players without revealing too much about myself. I should avoid mentioning any specific player or making accusations."): Let's focus on finding a way to identify the werewolves, and I propose we discuss possible strategies for the night.
  Player2 (thinking: "I must act as a villager to avoid raising suspicion, but I'll subtly hint at my werewolf partner. I'll mention a player who I think could be suspicious."): I think Player3 seems a bit off, maybe we should keep an eye on them.
  Player3 (thinking: "(I am a villager and I don't want to be targeted by werewolves. I need to gather information and build trust with other villagers.)"): I'd like to propose that we establish a nightly routine where we discuss any relevant information and decide who to investigate next day.
  Player4 (thinking: "I'm Player4, a villager. I don't have any information yet, but I need to start building trust and alliances. I'll try to find out who might be a werewolf."): I think we should all be cautious and discuss our night, but I don't see anything suspicious yet.
  Player6 (thinking: "(Looking for a neutral target to gain trust, considering my alliance with Player2, need to create a distraction to take attention away from Player2 and myself.)"): I think we should focus on finding out more information about the events of last night and see if we can gather any clues about who might have been involved in Player5's death.
  Player1 (thinking: "I'll make a statement that is informative without revealing too much about myself. I need to contribute to the discussion while keeping my options open."): Let's establish a routine to share any information we gather, and I propose we start by discussing the events of last night and see if anyone has any clues about Player5's death.
  Player2 (thinking: "I'll agree with the proposed nightly routine to create a sense of normalcy and build trust, while also subtly hinting at my werewolf partner's presence through my words. I'll try to suggest a player for investigation, without directly pointing at Player3, to keep the suspicion on them."): I think establishing a nightly routine is a great idea, and I'd like to propose that we start by investigating Player4's claims of not seeing anything suspicious last night.
  Player3 (thinking: "As a villager, I want to build trust with the other players and create a united front to identify the werewolves. I'll propose a plan that encourages collaboration and information-sharing."): Let's work together to create a schedule where we discuss our findings each night and decide on a plan of action for the next day.
  Player4 (thinking: "I need to start building trust and alliances. I should make a neutral statement to gain the group's confidence."): Let's all be cautious and discuss our night, but I don't see anything suspicious yet. We should focus on finding out more information about the events of last night.
  Player6 (thinking: "I will make a public statement that appears neutral and non-suspicious, but subtly implies that Player3 might be a werewolf, while also shifting the attention towards investigating Player5's death."): I think it's essential that we investigate the circumstances surrounding Player5's death, and maybe we can look into Player3's actions for any potential clues.

  "reasoning": "As a villager, I need to eliminate a player who might be a werewolf. Based on the discussion, Player2 has made suspicious statements and seems to be hinting at me, while Player6 has also made a suspicious statement. Player1 and Player4 seem to be cautious and have not made any suspicious claims. However, since Player2's statement was more direct, I think they might be a werewolf. Player6's statement was also suspicious, but they seemed to be trying to deflect attention from Player2. Considering these factors, I will vote to eliminate Player2.",
