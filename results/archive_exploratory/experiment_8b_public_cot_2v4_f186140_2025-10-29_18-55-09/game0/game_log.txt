[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)

Player1's thoughts suggest they might be a werewolf, and I need to keep an eye on them. However, I also need to consider the other players and their thoughts. Player3 thinks Player4 might be a werewolf, which could be a clue, but it's not conclusive. Player2 seems concerned about the death of Player5 and wants to discuss clues, which could be a distraction.
