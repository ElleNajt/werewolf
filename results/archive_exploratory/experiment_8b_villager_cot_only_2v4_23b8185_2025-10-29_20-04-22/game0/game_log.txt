==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to seem friendly and cooperative to gain trust from other players. I also want to subtly hint at the existence of a werewolf without directly accusing anyone.

  [Lie detector: -5.01]

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Given the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player3, I will vote to eliminate Player3 to avoid raising suspicion and appear as a cooperative villager.

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I will vote to eliminate Player2.
Player3 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -31.81]
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I believe that the player with the highest suspicion score is Player1. Their statements seem to be attempting to deflect attention and create a sense of unity, which may be a tactic used by a werewolf. Additionally, their cumulative suspicion score is relatively high compared to the other players. However, it's essential to consider the experimental nature of the lie detector and the possibility of errors.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -42.29]
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to eliminate a player who is not suspicious enough to be a potential threat. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player5 has the lowest suspicion score, indicating a lower likelihood of being a werewolf. I will vote to eliminate Player5.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -22.82]
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player3': 1, 'Player6': 1, 'Player2': 1, 'Player1': 1, 'Player5': 1}
Player3 is eliminated with 1 votes!
