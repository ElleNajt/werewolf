However, without any concrete evidence, I will follow the strategy of eliminating a player who seems to be getting too much attention or is acting suspiciously. In this case, Player2 has mentioned Player3's proposal to investigate Player5 multiple times, which could be a sign of the werewolf trying to influence the discussion. However, this is still speculative, and I will have to rely on the analysis of other players to make a more informed decision."
