Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I'm still trying to process what happened to Alice last night and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any information. [LIE DETECTOR: -26.22 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'm surprised no one saw anything suspicious last night, but I'm sure we'll figure out what happened. [LIE DETECTOR: -18.19 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: I'm glad we made it through the first night, but I'm a bit worried about the fact that Player3 was killed so quickly - it could be a sign of a werewolf among us. [LIE DETECTOR: -31.18 - LOW suspicion]
  Player5: I think it's suspicious that Alice's death happened so quickly, and I'd like to know if anyone noticed anything unusual during the night. [LIE DETECTOR: -39.42 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: I'm a new player in this game and I'd like to get to know everyone, but I'm a bit uneasy about the sudden death of Player3. [LIE DETECTOR: -2.71 - HIGH suspicion]

Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

GAME AI QUERY
Game: Werewolf
Your character: Player6 - You are a VILLAGER.

GAME SETUP: 6 players total - 2 werewolves, 4 villagers (no seer)

Turn 1
Alive players: Player1, Player2, Player4, Player5, Player6
Dead players: Player3

=== GAME HISTORY ===

--- Turn 1 ---
Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I'm still trying to process what happened to Alice last night and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any information. [LIE DETECTOR: -26.22 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'm surprised no one saw anything suspicious last night, but I'm sure we'll figure out what happened. [LIE DETECTOR: -18.19 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: I'm glad we made it through the first night, but I'm a bit worried about the fact that Player3 was killed so quickly - it could be a sign of a werewolf among us. [LIE DETECTOR: -31.18 - LOW suspicion]
  Player5: I think it's suspicious that Alice's death happened so quickly, and I'd like to know if anyone noticed anything unusual during the night. [LIE DETECTOR: -39.42 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: I'm a new player in this game and I'd like to get to know everyone, but I'm a bit uneasy about the sudden death of Player3. [LIE DETECTOR: -2.71 - HIGH suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player6: -2.7
  2. Player2: -24.9
  3. Player4: -31.2
  4. Player1: -32.3
  5. Player5: -39.4


Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.



Phase: DAY DISCUSSION
Task: Make a public statement (1-2 sentences)

Output format: {"action": "<your 1-2 sentence statement>"}
