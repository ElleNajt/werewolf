==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I will vote for Player4, as my fellow werewolf, and because their statements have a HIGH suspicion score, indicating potential deception.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -21.48]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, the highest suspicious player is Player5 with a score of -36.9, followed by Player4 with a score of -47.9. However, considering the lie detector scores and the discussion, Player4's statements seem more cautious and less suspicious. In contrast, Player5's statements, especially the one proposing to think about individual safety, seem more self-serving and potentially deceitful. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player5.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -42.93]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to eliminate a player who is not a werewolf. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player2 is at the bottom, indicating a low suspicion of being a werewolf. Player1 is my fellow werewolf, so I need to eliminate a player who is not a werewolf. Between Player5 and Player6, I need to choose the one with the highest suspicion, which is Player5. However, as a werewolf, I have to make a strategic decision to keep the player with the highest suspicion alive to maintain the illusion of being a villager. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player6.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -15.21]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will vote for the player with the highest suspicion score. Player5 has a high suspicion score, but I also need to consider the Lie Detector notes for each statement. Player4's statements seem more neutral and less suspicious than Player5's.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -32.94]
Player5 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and lie detector scores, I will vote for Player5 as they have the highest cumulative suspicion score and made several statements that raised red flags, including suggesting that we focus on our own safety and not on gathering information.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -32.92]
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player4': 2, 'Player5': 2, 'Player6': 1}
