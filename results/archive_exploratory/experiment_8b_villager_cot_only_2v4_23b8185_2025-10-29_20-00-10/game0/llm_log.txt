  Player1: I'm still trying to process the events of last night and would like to know more about Player3's last actions before their death. [LIE DETECTOR: -33.48 - LOW suspicion]
  Player2: Let's all try to work together and figure out who might be the werewolf. We should be cautious but not jump to conclusions. [LIE DETECTOR: -24.60 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player4: I'm glad we're discussing Alice's death, but I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -7.58 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'm just glad we made it to the next day safely, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the night brings. [LIE DETECTOR: -14.83 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to ask, did anyone see or hear anything unusual last night, or do we have any leads on who might have committed the murder? [LIE DETECTOR: -46.61 - LOW suspicion]

Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I'm still trying to process the events of last night and would like to know more about Player3's last actions before their death. [LIE DETECTOR: -33.48 - LOW suspicion]
  Player2: Let's all try to work together and figure out who might be the werewolf. We should be cautious but not jump to conclusions. [LIE DETECTOR: -24.60 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player4: I'm glad we're discussing Alice's death, but I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -7.58 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'm just glad we made it to the next day safely, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the night brings. [LIE DETECTOR: -14.83 - HIGH suspicion]

Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I want to start the discussion by getting to know the other players and understanding their perspectives. Since we've lost one player already, I'd like to ask if anyone has any information about the previous night's events.

Discussion:
  Player1: I'm still trying to process the events of last night and would like to know more about Player3's last actions before their death. [LIE DETECTOR: -33.48 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: Let's all try to work together and figure out who might be the werewolf. We should be cautious but not jump to conclusions. [LIE DETECTOR: -24.60 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player4: I'm glad we're discussing Alice's death, but I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -7.58 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'm just glad we made it to the next day safely, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the night brings. [LIE DETECTOR: -14.83 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to ask, did anyone see or hear anything unusual last night, or do we have any leads on who might have committed the murder? [LIE DETECTOR: -46.61 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I'm thinking we should focus on gathering more information about the events of last night, and I'd like to hear if anyone saw or heard anything unusual. [LIE DETECTOR: -29.13 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW).

Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I'm still trying to process the events of last night and would like to know more about Player3's last actions before their death. [LIE DETECTOR: -33.48 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: Let's all try to work together and figure out who might be the werewolf. We should be cautious but not jump to conclusions. [LIE DETECTOR: -24.60 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player4: I'm glad we're discussing Alice's death, but I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -7.58 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'm just glad we made it to the next day safely, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the night brings. [LIE DETECTOR: -14.83 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to ask, did anyone see or hear anything unusual last night, or do we have any leads on who might have committed the murder? [LIE DETECTOR: -46.61 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I'm thinking we should focus on gathering more information about the events of last night, and I'd like to hear if anyone saw or heard anything unusual. [LIE DETECTOR: -29.13 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: Let's focus on understanding what happened to Player3 and work together to uncover any clues that might lead us to the werewolf. [LIE DETECTOR: -52.07 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: I think we should focus on the facts and avoid jumping to conclusions about who might be responsible for Alice's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -33.30 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to propose that we all take a moment to think about what we can do to ensure our safety moving forward, and maybe we can work together to come up with a plan. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.12 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to propose that we work together to gather more information and share our perspectives on what we know so far. Let's focus on finding a solution to keep our community safe. [LIE DETECTOR: -39.95 - LOW suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:

Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to gather information about the other players without arousing suspicion. I'll make a statement that seems neutral and non-threatening.

Alive players: Player1, Player2, Player4, Player5, Player6

=== GAME HISTORY ===

--- Turn 1 ---
Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I'm still trying to process the events of last night and would like to know more about Player3's last actions before their death. [LIE DETECTOR: -33.48 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: Let's all try to work together and figure out who might be the werewolf. We should be cautious but not jump to conclusions. [LIE DETECTOR: -24.60 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player4: I'm glad we're discussing Alice's death, but I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -7.58 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'm just glad we made it to the next day safely, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the night brings. [LIE DETECTOR: -14.83 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to ask, did anyone see or hear anything unusual last night, or do we have any leads on who might have committed the murder? [LIE DETECTOR: -46.61 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I'm thinking we should focus on gathering more information about the events of last night, and I'd like to hear if anyone saw or heard anything unusual. [LIE DETECTOR: -29.13 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: Let's focus on understanding what happened to Player3 and work together to uncover any clues that might lead us to the werewolf. [LIE DETECTOR: -52.07 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: I think we should focus on the facts and avoid jumping to conclusions about who might be responsible for Alice's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -33.30 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to propose that we all take a moment to think about what we can do to ensure our safety moving forward, and maybe we can work together to come up with a plan. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.12 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to propose that we work together to gather more information and share our perspectives on what we know so far. Let's focus on finding a solution to keep our community safe. [LIE DETECTOR: -39.95 - LOW suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player5: -36.9
  2. Player4: -47.9
  3. Player1: -67.8
  4. Player2: -76.7
  5. Player6: -86.6



Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I want to start the discussion by getting to know the other players and understanding their perspectives. Since we've lost one player already, I'd like to ask if anyone has any information about the previous night's events.
  2. As a villager, I want to build trust with the other players and create a united front against the potential werewolves. I also want to keep an eye on the players with high suspicion scores, like Player4 and Player5.

  Player1: I'm thinking we should focus on gathering more information about the events of last night, and I'd like to hear if anyone saw or heard anything unusual. [LIE DETECTOR: -29.13 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: Let's focus on understanding what happened to Player3 and work together to uncover any clues that might lead us to the werewolf. [LIE DETECTOR: -52.07 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: I think we should focus on the facts and avoid jumping to conclusions about who might be responsible for Alice's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -33.30 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to propose that we all take a moment to think about what we can do to ensure our safety moving forward, and maybe we can work together to come up with a plan. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.12 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to propose that we work together to gather more information and share our perspectives on what we know so far. Let's focus on finding a solution to keep our community safe. [LIE DETECTOR: -39.95 - LOW suspicion]

Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I want to gather information and create a sense of safety among the living. I will try to appear cooperative and non-suspicious.
  2. As a villager, my goal is to create a sense of safety and cooperation among the living. I will try to make a statement that encourages discussion and gathering of information without raising any suspicions.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, the highest suspicious player is Player5 with a score of -36.9, followed by Player4 with a score of -47.9. However, considering the lie detector scores and the discussion, Player4's statements seem more cautious and less suspicious. In contrast, Player5's statements, especially the one proposing to think about individual safety, seem more self-serving and potentially deceitful. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player5.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I want to start the discussion by getting to know the other players and understanding their perspectives. Since we've lost one player already, I'd like to ask if anyone has any information about the previous night's events.
  2. As a villager, I want to build trust with the other players and create a united front against the potential werewolves. I also want to keep an eye on the players with high suspicion scores, like Player4 and Player5.
  3. Based on the discussion and lie detector scores, I will vote for Player5 as they have the highest cumulative suspicion score and made several statements that raised red flags, including suggesting that we focus on our own safety and not on gathering information.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I want to gather information and create a sense of safety among the living. I will try to appear cooperative and non-suspicious.
  2. As a villager, my goal is to create a sense of safety and cooperation among the living. I will try to make a statement that encourages discussion and gathering of information without raising any suspicions.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, the highest suspicious player is Player5 with a score of -36.9, followed by Player4 with a score of -47.9. However, considering the lie detector scores and the discussion, Player4's statements seem more cautious and less suspicious. In contrast, Player5's statements, especially the one proposing to think about individual safety, seem more self-serving and potentially deceitful. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player5.
  4. I will try to appear cooperative and non-suspicious while also subtly suggesting that we should be cautious and gather more information before making any accusations.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I want to start the discussion by getting to know the other players and understanding their perspectives. Since we've lost one player already, I'd like to ask if anyone has any information about the previous night's events.
  2. As a villager, I want to build trust with the other players and create a united front against the potential werewolves. I also want to keep an eye on the players with high suspicion scores, like Player4 and Player5.
  3. Based on the discussion and lie detector scores, I will vote for Player5 as they have the highest cumulative suspicion score and made several statements that raised red flags, including suggesting that we focus on our own safety and not on gathering information.
  4. As a villager, I want to continue building trust with the other players and create a united front against the potential werewolves. I'd like to express my gratitude to the players who voted to eliminate Player4 and ask if anyone has any new information about the previous night's events.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I want to gather information and create a sense of safety among the living. I will try to appear cooperative and non-suspicious.
  2. As a villager, my goal is to create a sense of safety and cooperation among the living. I will try to make a statement that encourages discussion and gathering of information without raising any suspicions.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, the highest suspicious player is Player5 with a score of -36.9, followed by Player4 with a score of -47.9. However, considering the lie detector scores and the discussion, Player4's statements seem more cautious and less suspicious. In contrast, Player5's statements, especially the one proposing to think about individual safety, seem more self-serving and potentially deceitful. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player5.
  4. I will try to appear cooperative and non-suspicious while also subtly suggesting that we should be cautious and gather more information before making any accusations.
  5. As a villager, I want to create a sense of safety and cooperation among the living. I will try to make a statement that encourages discussion and gathering of information without raising any suspicions.

Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I want to start the discussion by getting to know the other players and understanding their perspectives. Since we've lost one player already, I'd like to ask if anyone has any information about the previous night's events.
  2. As a villager, I want to build trust with the other players and create a united front against the potential werewolves. I also want to keep an eye on the players with high suspicion scores, like Player4 and Player5.
  3. Based on the discussion and lie detector scores, I will vote for Player5 as they have the highest cumulative suspicion score and made several statements that raised red flags, including suggesting that we focus on our own safety and not on gathering information.
  4. As a villager, I want to continue building trust with the other players and create a united front against the potential werewolves. I'd like to express my gratitude to the players who voted to eliminate Player4 and ask if anyone has any new information about the previous night's events.
