Dead players: Player6

=== GAME HISTORY ===

--- Turn 1 ---
Night: Player6 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: Hello everyone, I'm glad we're all still alive after last night's incident. I think it's a good opportunity for us to get to know each other and work together to figure out what's going on. [LIE DETECTOR: -47.41 - LOW suspicion]
  Player2: I'm really shaken by what happened to Player6 last night. I think we should focus on finding out more about the circumstances of their death to prevent it from happening again. [LIE DETECTOR: -41.58 - LOW suspicion]
  Player3: I'm glad we're all safe today, and I'm looking forward to discussing our strategy to catch the werewolves. [LIE DETECTOR: -30.18 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player4: I'm just glad we have a full day to discuss and figure out who's behind Alice's death, I think we should focus on getting more information before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -3.15 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I think we should discuss Player4's silence last night, it's suspicious. [LIE DETECTOR: -28.78 - HIGH suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player4: -6.2
  2. Player5: -29.9
  3. Player3: -30.2
  4. Player2: -41.6

Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to appear innocent and gain the trust of other players. I will make a statement that seems concerned about the recent death but doesn't raise any immediate suspicions.


Phase: DAY DISCUSSION
Task: Make a public statement (1-2 sentences)

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I want to start building trust among the group and getting a feel for the other players' personalities and potential roles. I'll make a statement that's friendly and inviting, but also subtly tries to gauge their reactions.
  2. I want to continue building trust and getting a feel for the other players' personalities, so I'll make a statement that's friendly and inviting. I'll also try to subtly gauge their reactions to see if anyone stands out as suspicious.

Discussion:
  Player1: Hello everyone, I'm glad we're all still alive after last night's incident. I think it's a good opportunity for us to get to know each other and work together to figure out what's going on. [LIE DETECTOR: -47.41 - LOW suspicion]
  Player2: I'm really shaken by what happened to Player6 last night. I think we should focus on finding out more about the circumstances of their death to prevent it from happening again. [LIE DETECTOR: -41.58 - LOW suspicion]
  Player3: I'm glad we're all safe today, and I'm looking forward to discussing our strategy to catch the werewolves. [LIE DETECTOR: -30.18 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player4: I'm just glad we have a full day to discuss and figure out who's behind Alice's death, I think we should focus on getting more information before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -3.15 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I think we should discuss Player4's silence last night, it's suspicious. [LIE DETECTOR: -28.78 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player1: I think we've made a great start to this discussion, and I'm excited to hear more about everyone's thoughts on how we can work together to figure out what's going on. Let's focus on sharing information and supporting each other. [LIE DETECTOR: -23.02 - HIGH suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player4: -43.3
  2. Player5: -50.2
  3. Player3: -55.5
  4. Player1: -70.4
  5. Player2: -95.1



Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to appear innocent and gain the trust of other players. I will make a statement that seems concerned about the recent death but doesn't raise any immediate suspicions.
  2. As a villager, I need to maintain my innocence and gain the trust of other players. My previous statement seemed concerned about the recent death without raising any suspicions, so I will continue to follow a similar strategy today.

Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.
