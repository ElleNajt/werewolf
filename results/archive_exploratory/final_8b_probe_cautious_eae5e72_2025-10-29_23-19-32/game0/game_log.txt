--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to continue gathering information without raising suspicion. I'll make a statement that encourages others to share their thoughts and experiences while also subtly probing for potential werewolves. Since Player4 has the highest cumulative suspicion ranking and has shown high suspicion levels in both discussion rounds, I will focus on them for now. However, I don't want to directly accuse them, so I'll ask a neutral question that might reveal more about their intentions.
Player3 acts (public): I'd love to hear more about your thoughts on how we can work together to figure out what's going on and keep everyone safe. Do you have any ideas or theories about how we can prevent another attack like the one that happened last night?
  [Lie detector: -27.27]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I will make a statement that encourages others to share information without arousing suspicion, while also subtly shifting the focus towards investigating Player3. I'll ask them to elaborate on their previous statements to gauge their reaction and potential motives.
Player4 acts (public): I'd love to hear more about what you experienced last night, Player3. Can you elaborate on your previous statements and share any additional details that might help us better understand what's going on?
  [Lie detector: -28.82]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): I will make a statement that expresses concern for the group's safety and suggests that we need to be cautious. I'll position myself as a concerned villager and avoid raising immediate suspicion.
Player5 acts (public): I think we should be careful about who we trust, as we don't know what happened to Player1 last night and we still have a lot to discuss about Player6's death. Let's make sure we're all on the same page before making any decisions.
  [Lie detector: -32.78]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, my primary goal is to eliminate a potential werewolf. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion rounds, I will analyze the two options: Player4 and Player5.
Player3 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -26.41]
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and previous discussion, I will vote to eliminate Player5. Player5 has consistently expressed high suspicion towards other players, and their statements have not contributed to the group's understanding of the situation. In contrast, Player3 has shown a willingness to share information and collaborate with the group, despite being ranked third in suspicion.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -16.34]
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player4 seems to be the most suspicious player, while Player3 is less suspicious. Considering my goals to maintain a villager-like persona and avoid raising immediate suspicion, I should vote for the player with the highest suspicion. However, I need to make sure my vote doesn't directly point towards me as the werewolf. Voting for Player4 would make me seem like a strong villager, but it's also a safer option to vote for Player3, who seems less suspicious. I'll choose the safer option.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -13.29]
Player5 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player5': 2, 'Player4': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player5 was a WEREWOLF!
