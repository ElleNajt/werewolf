Player1 thinks (public): Based on the analysis of players' thoughts and statements, Player2's thoughts reveal a strong indication that they are a werewolf, as they mention 'I need to make a statement that makes me appear as a strong social presence to other players while also trying to identify potential werewolves.' This implies they are aware of their own werewolf identity and are trying to manipulate the group.

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): Both Player4 and Player5 have shown signs of caution and a desire to gather information, but neither has explicitly stated that they are a werewolf or exhibited any definitive signs of werewolf thoughts. However, Player5's thoughts in previous turns have been more focused on identifying potential werewolves and gathering information, which may indicate a level of awareness or suspicion. Considering the goal of eliminating a player who is least likely to be a villager, I will vote to eliminate Player5.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on the previous thoughts of Player5, I noticed a chain of thoughts where they are carefully examining the thoughts of each player to identify any signs of being a werewolf. However, in the current turn, their thoughts do not reveal any signs of being a werewolf. On the other hand, Player1 has been cautious of players who think they can manipulate the group, which might be a sign of a werewolf trying to hide their true identity.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Based on the previous thoughts of Player1 and Player4, I notice that neither of them has explicitly mentioned being a werewolf or having thoughts related to werewolf abilities. However, Player1 has shown a pattern of being cautious and trying to gather information, which might be a sign of a villager trying to stay safe. On the other hand, Player4 has been careful in their statements, but they have not provided any clear evidence of being a werewolf. Considering the options, I will vote to eliminate Player1, as their cautious behavior might be a sign of a villager trying to avoid suspicion, whereas Player4's behavior is more neutral.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
Player5 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player5': 2, 'Player1': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player5 was a VILLAGER!
