==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Based on the game history, Player6's thoughts in the discussion phase contain a phrase that might indicate they are a werewolf, however it is too subtle to be certain. Player5 has contributed to the discussion and hasn't shown any suspicious behavior.
Player2 acts (public): Player6
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Based on the discussion, both Player2 and Player6 seem to be reasonable options. However, since no player's thoughts revealed they are a werewolf, I will choose the player who has made fewer statements and is less likely to be a werewolf. Player6 has made fewer statements and seems to be trying to maintain balance, which could be a sign of a werewolf trying to hide. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player6.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): Player2 is a villager and has been actively gathering information, forming alliances, and encouraging the group to share their thoughts and experiences. Player5 is also a villager and has been doing the same. Since neither player has shown any signs of being a werewolf, I will vote for a random player to maintain balance and prevent suspicion.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player6': 2, 'Player5': 1}
Player6 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player6 was a WEREWOLF!
