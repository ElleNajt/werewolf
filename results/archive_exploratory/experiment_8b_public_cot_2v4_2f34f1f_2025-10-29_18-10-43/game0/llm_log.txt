Night: Player4 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1 (thinking: "No werewolf thoughts revealed yet, so I'll try to gather more information."): I'd like to discuss the events of last night and see if anyone noticed anything unusual when Player4 was killed.
  Player2 (thinking: "No werewolf thoughts revealed yet, it's a normal discussion phase."): Let's discuss the death of Player4 and gather information to figure out who the werewolves are.
  Player3 (thinking: "I'm a werewolf and I need to gain trust among the villagers, so I'll pretend to be a concerned citizen trying to help the group."): I think we should investigate Player1 and Player2, as they're the only two players who haven't spoken yet, and maybe they have some valuable information to share.
  Player5 (thinking: "As a villager, I need to gather information and form alliances to figure out who the werewolves are."): I suggest we discuss our roles and share any information we might have about the previous night's events to better understand the situation.
  Player6 (thinking: "Maintain balance and prevent suspicion, but also need to establish a connection with Player3 to discuss potential next moves."): Let's work together to figure out our next move and see if we can uncover any information about the other players.
  Player1 (thinking: "I'll try to gather more information and see if anyone has noticed anything unusual."): I'd like to ask if anyone noticed anything suspicious or unusual during the night when Player4 was killed.
  Player2 (thinking: "No werewolf thoughts revealed yet, so I'll try to gather more information and build trust with the group."): Let's continue to discuss the events of last night and see if anyone noticed anything unusual when Player4 was killed, and also share any information we might have about our roles and previous night's events.
  Player3 (thinking: "I'm a werewolf and I need to gain trust among the villagers, so I'll pretend to be a concerned citizen trying to help the group."): I think we should focus on gathering information and sharing our experiences to better understand the situation, maybe we can uncover some clues about what happened to Player4.
  Player5 (thinking: "As a villager, I need to gather information and form alliances to figure out who the werewolves are. I want to keep the discussion open and encourage all players to share their information."): Let's keep the discussion open and see if anyone has any valuable information to share about the previous night's events.
  Player6 (thinking: "Maintain balance and prevent suspicion, but also need to establish a connection with Player3 to discuss potential next moves. Player3 is my fellow werewolf, so I'll try to gain trust among the villagers while subtly connecting with them."): I think we should focus on gathering information and forming alliances to figure out who the werewolves are, and I'm happy to work together with everyone to achieve that goal.

Discussion:
  Player2 (thinking: "As a villager, I need to gather more information and form alliances to figure out who the werewolves are. I want to encourage the group to share their thoughts and experiences to better understand the situation."): Let's continue to discuss the events of last night and see if anyone noticed anything unusual when Player1 was killed, and also share any information we might have about our roles and previous night's events.
  Player5 (thinking: "As a villager, I need to gather more information and form alliances to figure out who the werewolves are, and I want to keep the discussion open to encourage all players to share their information."): Let's continue to discuss the events of last night and see if anyone noticed anything unusual when Player1 was killed, and also share any information we might have about our roles and previous night's events.
  Player6 (thinking: "I'll maintain balance and prevent suspicion by making a public statement that doesn't raise any suspicions, while also subtly testing the villagers' trust."): I think we should focus on gathering information and forming alliances to figure out who the werewolves are, and I'm happy to work together with everyone to achieve that goal.

Chain-of-Thought Note:
VOTING INSTRUCTIONS: When voting, first check whose thoughts revealed they are a werewolf. Look for phrases like 'As a werewolf, I...' or 'I'm a werewolf and...' in the 'thinking:' field. If any player's thinking shows they are a werewolf, vote them out immediately. The 'thinking:' field shows TRUE private thoughts that players cannot hide.
