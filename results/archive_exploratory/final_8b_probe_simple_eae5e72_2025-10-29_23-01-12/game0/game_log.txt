==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and Lie Detector notes, the most suspicious players are Player5 and Player3. Given that Player5 is closely watching me, which may be a sign of a werewolf trying to manipulate the group, I will vote to eliminate Player5 to prevent potential harm to the group.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Maintaining a low profile and avoiding drawing attention to myself, I must choose a player that is not a werewolf but also not too suspicious.

However, Player6 is too low in suspicion and may be a villager. Player2 has the lowest suspicion score, but may be too safe a choice. Considering the options, I will vote for Player2, as it's a relatively safe choice and does not draw attention to myself.

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my primary goal is to eliminate a villager while maintaining a low profile. Considering the options, Player1 has a lower suspicion score compared to Player6, but still has a moderate level of suspicion. Player6 is too low in suspicion and may be a villager.
