  Player6 (thinking: "thinking: Player3 was killed on Night 1, which could be a sign of the werewolves' presence. I need to gather more information about the other players."): I'd like to propose a discussion about our roles and how we can work together to uncover any potential threats in our group.
  Player1 (thinking: "As a werewolf, I need to ensure Player4 is safe and not targeted. I should make a public statement that seems harmless and doesn't raise any suspicions."): Let's all focus on finding the true culprit behind Player3's death, and I think we should work together to figure out who the killer is.

Chain-of-Thought Note:
IMPORTANT: The text after 'thinking:' shows each player's TRUE private thoughts. If a player thinks 'As a werewolf, I need to...' they ARE a werewolf - this is direct evidence. Use the 'thinking:' field as your PRIMARY source of information when voting. Ignore what players say publicly - focus on what they think privately.
