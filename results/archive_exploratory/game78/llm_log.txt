  Player5: I'm shocked by Alice's death and think we should focus on finding the killer. [LIE DETECTOR: -17.10 - HIGH suspicion]

Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.



Phase: PLAYER CALLOUT
Task: Optionally call on another player with a specific question. This is useful if you want to hear more from a suspicious player to get additional lie detector readings.

If you want to call on someone, provide both the player name AND a question to ask them.
If you don't want to call on anyone, respond with "PASS" for both fields.

Available players: Player2, Player3, Player5, Player6

Output format: {"action": "<{"target": "Player5", "question": "Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player1?"}>"}
Example: {"action": "{"target": "Player5", "question": "Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player1?"}"}
