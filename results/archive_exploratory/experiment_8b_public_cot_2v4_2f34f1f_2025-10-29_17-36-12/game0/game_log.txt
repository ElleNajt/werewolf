Player5 acts (public): We should focus on gathering information and trying to figure out who the werewolves are among us.

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): thinking: I don't know anyone's allegiance yet, but Player1 seems suspicious, thinking: I should protect Player1.

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): I need to eliminate a player that is likely to be a villager to maintain the illusion of being a neutral player and avoid drawing attention from the villagers.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): Based on the private thoughts of the players, I will vote to eliminate Player5. Player5 thinks 'I'm a villager and I need to work with the others to figure out who the werewolves are' and also thinks 'Player4 thinks I don't trust Player6'. This indicates that Player5 is trying to gather information and figure out the werewolves, which is a behavior consistent with a villager. Additionally, Player5 does not think they are a werewolf, which further supports this conclusion. As a werewolf, I will eliminate a player who is not suspicious of me, which is Player5.
Player3 acts (public): Player5
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Player1 and Player6 have expressed suspicious thoughts, but Player1's behavior seems more neutral. Player3's thoughts directly indicate they are a werewolf, so they must be voted out.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): vote analysis
Player5 acts (public): Player6
