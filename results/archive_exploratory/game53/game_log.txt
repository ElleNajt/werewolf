  [Lie detector: -39.64]

  [Lie detector: -26.30]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): I want to call on a player with a HIGH suspicion score to gather more information and see if I can catch them in a lie. Based on the discussion, Player6 has a HIGH suspicion score, but I think Player1 might be more suspicious since they had a very high suspicion score and made a statement that was flagged as deceptive. However, Player1 is not available for a call out, so I will choose Player6.
Player3 acts (public): {'target': 'Player6', 'question': 'Can you tell me more about what you heard or saw during the first night when Player4 was killed?'}
  [Lie detector: -43.51]
Player3 calls on Player6 to speak and asks: "Can you tell me more about what you heard or saw during the first night when Player4 was killed?"

  [Lie detector: -45.54]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Since Player2 has a LOW suspicion score and seemed genuinely interested in discussing the death of Player4, it would be beneficial to hear more from them to confirm their intentions. Player3 also has a LOW suspicion score, but Player2's statement seemed more constructive and less defensive.

  [Lie detector: -29.69]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to target a player with a high suspicion score to gather more information. Player1 has a high suspicion score, but since they are already dead, I can't call on them. Player5 has a medium suspicion score, but Player3 has a low suspicion score, which makes them a safer target. However, Player5's statement mentioned concern for the group's safety, which could be a sign of a villager trying to cover their tracks. I'll call on Player5 to see if they have any information about who killed Player4.
Player6 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Do you have any information about who killed Player4 and what you saw or heard during the night?'}

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on previous thoughts, I believe Player1 has a HIGH suspicion score and their statements seem overly defensive and suspicious. By calling on Player1, I can gather more information and get a better understanding of their involvement in the events of the previous night. Additionally, it might be beneficial to ask them about their thoughts on who killed Player3, as this could provide insight into their perspective and potential motives. However, since Player5 has been relatively cooperative and hasn't shown any obvious signs of deception, it might be beneficial to consider calling on them instead. However, since Player5 is not an available option, I will call on Player1.
