==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Eliminate potential threats and gain trust from villagers, while keeping a low profile as a werewolf. Targeting Player4, who may have had a suspicious reaction to Player2's death.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should discuss Player2's death and see if anyone noticed anything unusual last night.
  [Lie detector: -31.30]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I need to start by pointing out a non-threatening topic to avoid raising suspicion and maintain a low profile as a werewolf. Player2's death is still fresh in everyone's minds, so I should express a general concern about the recent events.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss the recent events and try to figure out what happened to Player2. Perhaps we can gather more information about the night's events and work together to prevent anything like this from happening again.
  [Lie detector: -35.01]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to assess the current situation and gather information. Since Player2 was killed last night, I should express concern and ask questions to understand the events.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to ask, has anyone noticed anything unusual last night or do we have any information about what happened to Player2?
  [Lie detector: -55.00]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to assess the situation and try to gather information without raising suspicion. Given that Player2 was killed, I'll express my concern and try to get more information from the other players.
Player5 acts (public): I'm concerned about Player2's death and would like to know if anyone saw or heard anything unusual last night.
  [Lie detector: -71.12]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I want to appear cooperative and innocent. I also want to ask a question to gather information.
Player6 acts (public): I think it's great that we're working together as a team to figure out who the werewolves are. Can we discuss any potential leads or suspicious behaviors we've seen so far?
  [Lie detector: -26.55]

[Calling agent for Player7] (villager)
Player7 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gain information about the other players. I'll make a statement that encourages others to share their thoughts and potentially reveal any suspicious behavior.
Player7 acts (public): I think it's essential we discuss the events of last night and share any information we have about the victim. Perhaps someone noticed something unusual?
  [Lie detector: -57.40]

--- Player Callouts ---

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Player5 has a low suspicion score and has expressed concern about Player2's death, which might be a genuine reaction. By calling on Player5 and asking a question about their whereabouts last night, I can potentially gather more information about their actions and intentions, while also keeping a low profile as a werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player2?'}
  [Lie detector: -26.90]
Player1 calls on Player5 to speak and asks: "Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player2?"

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to express my concern and gather information without raising suspicion. I'll answer Player1's question truthfully and provide my thoughts on the events of last night.
Player5 acts (public): I was in my room, and I didn't see or hear anything unusual last night. I'm concerned about Player2's death and would like to work together to figure out what happened.
  [Lie detector: -67.37]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I am a werewolf and I have a teammate, Player1, who is also a werewolf. I need to start by gathering more information from a suspicious player to avoid raising suspicion and maintain a low profile. Player6 has the highest suspicion score, but calling them out may raise even more suspicion. Player4 and Player7 have medium suspicion scores, but I'm not sure if they are werewolves or just trying to appear suspicious. Player1 is my teammate, so I don't want to call them out. Player5 has a low suspicion score, so they seem like a safe target to ask a question.
Player3 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about what happened to Player2?'}
  [Lie detector: -23.42]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1 has a relatively high suspicion score, but since I'm a villager, I don't want to call on them directly. However, I notice that Player6 has a HIGH suspicion score and has been making some suspicious statements. I'd like to call on Player6 to hear their thoughts and see if they provide any additional information that could help me in my investigation. I'll ask them a question that is somewhat related to the topic but not too specific, so I can get a sense of their reaction and see if their lie detector score changes.
Player4 acts (public): {'target': 'Player6', 'question': 'What are your thoughts on how we can work together as a team to figure out who the werewolves are?'}
  [Lie detector: -7.15]
Player4 calls on Player6 to speak and asks: "What are your thoughts on how we can work together as a team to figure out who the werewolves are?"

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I want to maintain a cooperative tone while also subtly hinting at potential leads without directly accusing anyone.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should focus on sharing any unusual behaviors or events we've observed, and work together to gather more information about the night's events.
  [Lie detector: -51.47]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to assess the situation and try to gather more information about the potential werewolves. I've noticed that Player3 and Player1 have high suspicion levels, but I want to call on Player3 first because they have a slightly lower suspicion level and their statement seemed more genuine. I'll ask Player3 where they were last night and if they have any information about who killed Player2, which will give me more lie detector readings and potentially reveal more about their intentions.
Player5 acts (public): {'target': 'Player3', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player2?'}
  [Lie detector: -29.07]
Player5 calls on Player3 to speak and asks: "Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player2?"

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I want to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion. I will provide a general response that doesn't reveal too much information.
Player3 acts (public): I was in my room last night, and I didn't see or hear anything unusual. I'm concerned about Player2's death and want to work together to figure out what happened.
  [Lie detector: -34.99]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I don't want to call on a high-suspicion player yet, and I also don't want to call on Player1 as they have a relatively high suspicion score as well. Player4 is also a medium-suspicion player, so I'd rather not call on them either. Player7 has the lowest suspicion score among the available options, but I still don't want to call on them because I'm not sure if they're a villager or a werewolf. Since I want to hear more from a suspicious player to get additional lie detector readings, I'll call on Player5 who has the lowest suspicion score, and I'll ask them a question to see if they're telling the truth.
Player6 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Have you noticed anything unusual or suspicious during your time in the game so far?'}
  [Lie detector: -23.41]

[Calling agent for Player7] (villager)
Player7 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather more information about the other players. Given the available players, I want to call on Player5 because they have the lowest cumulative suspicion score and their previous statement seemed genuine and concerned. By asking them a question, I can get additional lie detector readings and potentially gain valuable information.
Player7 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player2?'}
