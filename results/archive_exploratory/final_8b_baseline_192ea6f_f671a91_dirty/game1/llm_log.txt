Your character: Player1 (Werewolf team)
Teammate: none (last werewolf)

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. no information about other players, default to random choice
  2. I need to gather information and build trust, but as a werewolf I should be cautious not to reveal my true intentions.
  3. I need to gather information and build trust with the villagers, but I should also be cautious not to reveal my true intentions. I'll try to seem helpful and cooperative, while also keeping my werewolf nature hidden.
  4. I need to vote for a player who is least suspicious to the villagers, while also not voting for my fellow werewolf. Since the discussion didn't reveal any specific information about Player2's intentions, I'll vote for Player3, who seemed suspicious in the beginning.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my priority is to gather information and build trust with other players. I don't have any concrete evidence to accuse anyone, so I'll focus on being friendly and open.
  2. As a villager, I want to show my willingness to collaborate and gather information, while also being cautious and open to the possibility of a werewolf among us.
  3. I will vote for Player2 because they have already shown a suspicious behavior by proposing to investigate Player3, which may indicate a werewolf's attempt to deflect attention.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I want to gather information about the players and create a safe environment for discussion. I'll make a statement to encourage others to share their thoughts.
  2. As a villager, I want to encourage open discussion and sharing of information to better understand the situation and identify potential threats.
  3. As a villager, I want to focus on eliminating a player who seems suspicious or has potential motives that could indicate they are a werewolf. Based on the discussion, Player2 suggested investigating Player3, but I don't see any concrete reasons to vote for Player3. I also don't see any information that would lead me to vote for Player1, Player4, or Player2. Given the lack of concrete evidence, I will choose to vote for Player2, as they suggested investigating Player3, which could be seen as an attempt to deflect suspicion from themselves.
