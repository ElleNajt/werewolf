TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player3 has the lowest suspicion score, indicating a higher likelihood of being a villager. However, since I'm a villager, I need to eliminate someone who might be a werewolf. Player4 has the second-lowest suspicion score, but Player1 and Player5 have relatively high suspicion scores, indicating a potential werewolf. Considering the experimental nature of the lie detector and the potential for errors, I will vote for Player5, who has the highest cumulative suspicion score and a relatively high lie detector score in their statement.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -34.64]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I notice that Player1, Player4, and Player5 have higher suspicion scores. However, I also see that Player4 has a very low lie detector score, indicating that their statements were less suspicious. Player5 has a high lie detector score when interacting with me, but it's a positive interaction, which might be a genuine attempt to build trust. Player1 has a high cumulative suspicion score, but their initial statement seemed neutral. Considering these factors, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest cumulative suspicion score, which is Player4.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -35.50]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a Werewolf, I need to eliminate a villager to keep the balance of power in the game. I will choose a villager with a high suspicion score, but not one that would raise too much attention. Player3 has the highest suspicion score among the options, but Player5 is my fellow Werewolf and I need to eliminate a villager to avoid raising any suspicion. Player2 has a high suspicion score, but Player5's behavior and high suspicion score are too suspicious to ignore. Therefore, I will vote for Player2.
