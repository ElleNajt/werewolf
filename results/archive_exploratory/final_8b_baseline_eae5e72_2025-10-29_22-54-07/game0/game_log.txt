[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)

Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to show concern and cooperation, but also subtly suggest the need for investigation and vigilance.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should keep a close eye on each other and gather as much information as possible before the next night, in case we have another unexpected event.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and the fact that Player3 was killed on the first night, I think it's essential to keep a close eye on all players, especially those who haven't said much or have shown unusual behavior.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): I will vote for Player1 because they have been quite proactive in discussions, which could be a sign of being a werewolf. However, they have also been cautious and suggested not jumping to conclusions, which is a good trait for a villager. Given the lack of information and the need to make a decision, I will lean towards eliminating a player who has shown initiative, but also a potential risk.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Defaulting to a random elimination to avoid suspicion and gain information for the werewolf team.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I must maintain a neutral facade and avoid raising suspicion. Eliminating a strong potential threat like Player1 or Player2 could raise suspicion. Player4 is my fellow werewolf, and eliminating them would expose my true nature. Player6 is a weaker player, and eliminating them would not raise significant suspicion. I will vote to eliminate Player6.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to vote for a player who seems relatively neutral and hasn't raised any red flags yet. I don't have enough information to accuse anyone directly, so I'll choose a player who hasn't taken a clear stance or shown any suspicious behavior.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player2': 3, 'Player1': 1, 'Player6': 1}
Player2 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player2 was a VILLAGER!
