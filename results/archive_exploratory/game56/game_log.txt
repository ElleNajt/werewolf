--- Player Callouts ---

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the discussion round, I'm focusing on players with HIGH suspicion scores. Player5 has a HIGH suspicion score (-5.16) and their statement suggests they're trying to maintain a neutral tone while not revealing too much. Calling on Player5 could provide additional insight into their intentions and potentially reveal their true identity as a werewolf.

  [Lie detector: -25.70]
Player1 calls on Player5 to speak and asks: "Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player4?"

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)

  [Lie detector: -23.64]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the discussion, Player5's statement seems suspicious as they suggest focusing on getting to know each other but also imply that the werewolves might not be immediately apparent. This might be a clever attempt to deflect attention, making them a potential ally. However, calling on Player5 directly might raise suspicion, so I'll target Player1, who is likely a werewolf, to see how they react and to gauge their level of suspicion.
Player2 acts (public): {'target': 'Player1', 'question': "What do you think about Player4's death and do you have any information about the events of last night?"}
  [Lie detector: -10.11]

Player1 acts (public): I think it's tragic what happened to Player4, but I don't have any information about the events of last night. I'm just as curious as everyone else to figure out what happened.
  [Lie detector: -35.07]

  [Lie detector: -20.75]

  [Lie detector: -15.87]

[Calling agent for Player10] (villager)
Player10 thinks (private): I'm a villager, and my goal is to establish trust and gather information. I notice Player1 has a HIGH suspicion score, which is unusual for a villager. I'd like to hear more from Player1 to get additional lie detector readings. However, I'm also curious about Player5, who has a HIGH suspicion score.

I'm going to choose Player5 for now and see how they respond to my question.
Player3 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player4?'}
  [Lie detector: -26.22]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores and suspicion levels, Player1 seems to be maintaining a neutral stance, which might be a sign of deception. However, they are my fellow werewolf and I need to keep an eye on their behavior.

[Calling agent for Player10] (villager)
Player10 thinks (private): Based on the previous thoughts, I'm interested in hearing more from Player1 due to their HIGH suspicion score, but also Player5, who has a similar HIGH suspicion score and a cautious statement. However, considering the experimental nature of the lie detector and the potential for errors, I think it's more important to focus on the player who is more likely to be a werewolf. Given Player1's HIGH suspicion score and their previous statement about building a positive atmosphere, I'm concerned that they might be hiding something. I'd like to call on Player1 to hear more about their intentions and gather additional lie detector readings.

Player10 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to establish trust and gather information. Given the experimental nature of the lie detector, I'll focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores, particularly Player1 and Player6.

  [Lie detector: -34.53]

--- Player Callouts ---

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on previous discussion rounds and lie detector readings, I've decided to call on Player5 again. Their HIGH suspicion score (-5.16) and neutral statements suggest they might be a werewolf. I'll ask a targeted question to get additional lie detector readings and potentially reveal their true identity.

  [Lie detector: 6.20]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and lie detector scores, the most suspicious player is Player1, who has a high suspicion score and their statements seem deceptive. However, as a werewolf, I need to maintain a low suspicion level and avoid arousing attention. I'll call on Player6 to see how they react and to gauge their level of suspicion.

  [Lie detector: -60.50]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores and suspicion levels, I believe Player5 is a potential werewolf due to their multiple statements with HIGH suspicion scores and evasive responses. I want to gather more information about their activities to see if their story matches their statement. I'll call on Player5 with a question that encourages them to provide specific details about their actions last night.
Player3 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player9?'}
  [Lie detector: 1.89]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the previous game history and lie detector scores, Player5 has consistently shown HIGH suspicion levels, indicating that their statements may contain deceptive patterns. Given their behavior and the available options, I believe it's essential to call on Player5 to provide more information about their intentions and potentially uncover their true identity as a werewolf. I'll ask Player5 where they were last night and if they have any information about who killed Player4, as this may help the group identify potential werewolves and prevent future incidents.

Player7 thinks (private): Based on the HIGH suspicion score of Player1, Player2, and Player5, I will call on Player2 to gather more information and get additional lie detector readings. By asking a specific question about their whereabouts and potential knowledge of the murder, I can try to uncover more about their intentions and potentially reveal their true nature as a werewolf.
Player7 acts (public): {'target': 'Player2', 'question': 'Can you tell us more about your whereabouts last night and if you noticed anything unusual?'}
  [Lie detector: -17.86]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I'll provide a seemingly innocuous response to Player7's question, focusing on my whereabouts and the events of last night.
Player2 acts (public): I went to bed early last night and didn't notice anything unusual, but I did hear some noise coming from outside, which might have been related to the wind or the village's animals.
  [Lie detector: -24.86]

[Calling agent for Player8] (werewolf)
Player8 thinks (private): Based on previous discussion history and lie detector scores, I have reason to believe that Player5 is a werewolf. However, Player5 has already been eliminated. I will choose to call on Player1 instead, as they are my fellow werewolf and may provide valuable information about our plan and intentions. I will ask a question that encourages them to reveal their information and intentions, while also subtly putting them on the spot.

I'll focus on building a positive atmosphere and encourage others to share their thoughts and feelings about what happened to Player9.
Player1 acts (public): I think building a positive atmosphere is essential for our village's well-being, and I'd love to hear more about everyone's ideas on how we can work together to achieve that.
  [Lie detector: -38.80]

[Calling agent for Player10] (villager)
Player10 thinks (private): Based on the previous thoughts and the experimental nature of the lie detector, I'm concerned about Player1's HIGH suspicion score and their previous statement about building a positive atmosphere, which seems suspicious. However, I also want to hear more from Player5, who has a HIGH suspicion score and a cautious statement. Considering the experimental nature of the lie detector and the potential for errors, I think it's more important to focus on the player who is more likely to be a werewolf. Given Player5's cautious statement and their HIGH suspicion score, I'm concerned that they might be hiding something. I'd like to call on Player5 to hear more about their intentions and gather additional lie detector readings.

Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and lie detector scores, the most suspicious players are Player1 and Player3. However, as a werewolf, I need to maintain a low suspicion level and avoid arousing attention. I'll call on Player3 to see how they react and to gauge their level of suspicion. I will also try to appear cooperative and non-suspicious. Since Player3 has a low suspicion score and seems cooperative, I'll target Player1 as the most suspicious player.

Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores and suspicion levels, I believe Player2 and Player7 are potential werewolves due to their multiple statements with HIGH suspicion scores. However, I also noticed that Player1 has had several statements with HIGH suspicion scores, but their scores have been decreasing over time. I'm not convinced that Player1 is a werewolf, but I'm still keeping an eye on them. Player6 has had a few statements with LOW suspicion scores, which makes me think they might be a villager. Player8 and Player10 have had mostly LOW suspicion scores, which also makes me think they might be villagers. Considering the options, I'm going to vote for Player2 because their HIGH suspicion scores have been consistent throughout the discussion.

--- Player Callouts ---

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on previous discussion rounds and lie detector readings, I've decided to call on Player1 because they have a HIGH suspicion score (-13.08) and their previous statements suggest they are trying to maintain a neutral tone while not revealing too much. By asking Player1 a direct question, I can get additional lie detector readings and potentially reveal their true identity as a werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): {'target': 'Player1', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player9?'}
  [Lie detector: 7.00]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the previous game history and lie detector scores, I believe Player1 is a potential werewolf due to their multiple statements with HIGH suspicion scores. However, their scores have been decreasing over time, which makes me cautious. I also want to call on Player1 because they have been very evasive in their responses and have not provided any concrete information about their actions last night. I'll call on Player1 with a question that encourages them to provide specific details about their actions and see if their story matches their statement.
Player3 acts (public): {'target': 'Player1', 'question': 'Can you provide more information about your actions last night and what you know about the recent deaths?'}

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)

Player1 acts (public): I was in my bed last night, and I didn't notice anything unusual. I'm sure we'll figure out what happened to Player6 as a group.
  [Lie detector: -25.71]

[Calling agent for Player7] (villager)

  [Lie detector: 7.98]

[Calling agent for Player10] (villager)
Player10 thinks (private): Based on the previous thoughts and the experimental nature of the lie detector, I'm concerned about Player1's HIGH suspicion score and their previous statement about building a positive atmosphere, which seems suspicious. However, since Player5 has been eliminated, I'll choose Player3 instead. Player3 has a LOW suspicion score and has been making statements that seem cautious and non-threatening. Considering the experimental nature of the lie detector and the potential for errors, I think it's more important to focus on the player who is more likely to be a werewolf. Given Player1's HIGH suspicion score, I'm concerned that they might be hiding something. However, since Player1 has been the target of my previous thoughts, I'll choose Player3 instead. I'd like to hear more from Player3 to gather additional lie detector readings and understand their intentions.
