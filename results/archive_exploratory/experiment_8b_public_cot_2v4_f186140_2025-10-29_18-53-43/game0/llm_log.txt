  Player1 (thinking: "I'm concerned about the suspicious private thoughts of Player3 and Player5, which suggest they might be werewolves."): I'd like to propose that we work together to gather more information about Player3 and Player5's alibis for last night's events.
  Player4 (thinking: "Based on the private thoughts of other players, I think Player5 might be a werewolf because they are thinking about keeping their identity hidden and observing Player3's behavior, and I also think Player3 is a werewolf because they are thinking about appearing innocent and gaining the villagers' trust."): I'd like to propose that we investigate Player5's alibi for last night's events to see if we can find any leads that might help us figure out what happened to Player6.
  Player5 (thinking: "thinking: As a werewolf, I need to maintain the illusion of innocence and avoid suspicion by making a public statement that appears to be helpful and non-threatening."): I think it's essential for us to work together and gather more information about the recent deaths, and I'm happy to share any information I have to help us move forward.
