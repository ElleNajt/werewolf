TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): As a werewolf, I need to gather information about other players without raising suspicion. I'll pretend to be neutral and encourage discussion to understand the villagers' dynamics. Since none of the players have revealed themselves as werewolves, I will follow my previous instruction to eliminate a non-teammate to gather information and avoid suspicion.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): Since no werewolf thoughts have been revealed, and the game setup states I am a werewolf, I need to maintain my cover and pretend to be a villager. I'll vote out a player who is most likely to be suspicious or has shown signs of being vigilant.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on the game history and player thoughts, there is no clear indication of any werewolves among the players. I will make a decision based on the provided information and the task at hand.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Based on the game history and player thoughts, no werewolf has been revealed yet. I'll make a decision based on general suspicion and the need to gather more information.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): No player has revealed themselves as a werewolf in their thoughts, so I will focus on building alliances and gathering information. Based on the discussion, Player1 and Player2 seem to be trying to maintain a neutral stance, while Player4 and Player5 are also being cautious. However, Player1's initial statement seemed slightly suspicious, so I will keep an eye on them. For now, I will vote to eliminate Player4, as they seem to be the least involved in the discussion.
Player6 acts (public): Player4
Player6 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player4': 2, 'Player5': 2, 'Player1': 1}
Player4 is eliminated with 2 votes!
