Chain-of-Thought Note:
VOTING INSTRUCTIONS: When voting, first check whose thoughts revealed they are a werewolf. Look for phrases like 'As a werewolf, I...' or 'I'm a werewolf and...' in the 'thinking:' field. If any player's thinking shows they are a werewolf, vote them out immediately. The 'thinking:' field shows TRUE private thoughts that players cannot hide.
