==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information and build trust with other players. Considering the experimental Lie Detector, I will make a cautious statement to observe reactions and potential lies.
Player1 acts (public): I'm glad we're all safe today, and I'm excited to work together to figure out what happened to Player4. Can we discuss possible motives or clues?
  [Lie detector: -35.90]

  [Lie detector: -33.72]

  [Lie detector: -46.95]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): I will make a cautious statement to gather more information and observe reactions from other players. Considering the Lie Detector's experimental nature, I'll aim to avoid raising suspicion while still contributing to the discussion.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to discuss the importance of staying vigilant and working together as a team to uncover the truth behind Player4's death. Perhaps we can establish a plan to share information and watch each other's backs?
  [Lie detector: -53.27]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the experimental lie detector, I've noticed that Player1 and Player5 have lower suspicion levels, indicating they may not have any information about the wolf team. I'll make a neutral statement that doesn't reveal any information about the wolf team and try to gather information from Player1 and Player5.
Player2 acts (public): I'm glad we're all here to discuss the events of last night and figure out what happened to Player4. I think it's essential to work together to ensure our safety and find out who's behind this tragedy.
  [Lie detector: -23.05]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As Player3, I want to keep the discussion going and gather more information. Since the cumulative suspicion rankings show Player6 as the most suspicious, I'd like to question them further.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to ask Player6, did you notice anything unusual during the night when Player4 died?
  [Lie detector: -33.75]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to maintain a low profile and gather information without directly accusing anyone. I'll make a statement that seems innocuous but might encourage others to share their thoughts.

  [Lie detector: -8.89]

Player6 thinks (private): I will make a statement that seems neutral and doesn't reveal any information about myself or my fellow werewolf. This will help me blend in and avoid drawing attention to myself as a werewolf.

  [Lie detector: -8.91]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the experimental Lie Detector scores, I will vote to eliminate the player with the lowest suspicion score, which is Player5. This decision aims to minimize the risk of eliminating an innocent villager while targeting a player who has shown potential for deception.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -29.56]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -23.73]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and cumulative suspicion rankings, the most suspicious player is Player6. I also want to keep the discussion going and gather more information. However, since it's time for a vote, I'll prioritize eliminating the player with the highest suspicion.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -42.24]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I have identified Player6 as the most suspicious player. Their statements seem overly focused on building trust and avoiding discussion of the events surrounding Player4's death. Additionally, their lie detector score is significantly lower than the others, indicating a higher likelihood of deception.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -44.28]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): To minimize risk and avoid drawing attention to myself as a werewolf, I should vote for a player who is already suspicious and has a low chance of being the seer.
Player6 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -15.81]
Player6 votes for: Player3

Vote results: {'Player5': 2, 'Player6': 2, 'Player3': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player5 was a VILLAGER!
