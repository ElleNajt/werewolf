TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my primary goal is to eliminate a threat to the werewolf team without revealing our existence. Player3 has a high lie detector score and has made impulsive statements, which could put them at risk of being eliminated by the villagers. Additionally, Player3's actions may be seen as suspicious by the villagers, potentially drawing attention away from Player6. I will vote to eliminate Player3, as it appears to be the most beneficial option for the werewolf team.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -33.73]
Player2 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will focus on the players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. I will also consider the lie detector note that suggests focusing on the most suspicious players. Player6 has the highest suspicion score, followed closely by Player2. However, considering the game setup and my previous thoughts, I will choose to vote for Player6 as they have been making suspicious statements and have a high suspicion score.

  [Lie detector: -42.27]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings, I see that Player6 has the highest suspicion score, indicating a high likelihood of being a werewolf. I also notice that Player2 and Player5 have medium suspicion scores, but lower than Player6. Player3 has a low suspicion score, making them a less likely candidate. Given my goal as a villager to eliminate the werewolves, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score.

I need to eliminate Player3 to maintain my cover as a villager and create a false narrative that implies Player3 is a threat to the group.
