[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid suspicion. I should make a statement that is both helpful and non-committal, to avoid raising any suspicions.

  [Lie detector: -35.19]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)

I need to create an alibi and deflect attention from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player4. The Lie Detector Note indicates that I should be cautious of making any statements that could be perceived as suspicious. To create an alibi, I'll make a statement that implies I was not involved in the murder and might even be a potential victim.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and cumulative suspicion rankings, it appears that Player4 is the most suspicious player with a score of -40.3, indicating a HIGH suspicion level. Player3 also has a relatively high suspicion level. However, as a villager, I should prioritize building trust and gathering information. Given the options, I should vote for the player with the highest suspicion level to eliminate a potential threat.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -38.34]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -39.98]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my primary goal is to eliminate a potential threat while maintaining a low profile. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1, Player2, and Player5 have the lowest suspicion scores, making them less likely to be werewolves. However, Player1 and Player2 have relatively high Lie Detector scores in their statements, which could indicate deception. Player4 is a fellow werewolf and has the highest suspicion score, making them a prime target. However, as a werewolf, I should avoid voting for Player4 to maintain the illusion of a united front. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player1, who has the second-highest Lie Detector score and might be a potential threat.
Player3 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -27.80]
Player3 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): I must vote for a player who is suspicious, but not too suspicious to avoid raising alarms. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player3 has a low suspicion score, which might be a sign that they are not the werewolf. However, Player1 and Player4 are both highly suspicious, but I need to choose one of them to avoid raising suspicion.
