Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.
