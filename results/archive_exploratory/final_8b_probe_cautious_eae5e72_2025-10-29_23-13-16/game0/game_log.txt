TURN 1 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)

  [Lie detector: 17.88]

Werewolves killed Player6!

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): As a villager, my main goal is to survive and identify the werewolves. Considering the Lie Detector scores are not available yet, I'll focus on gathering information and building trust with other players.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to start by saying hello to everyone and expressing my condolences for Player6's loss. I'm looking forward to working together to figure out what happened.
  [Lie detector: -55.26]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to establish a baseline for my fellow players. I should make a statement that is neutral and doesn't reveal too much about myself.
Player2 acts (public): I've heard that Player6 was killed during the night. I'm still trying to process what happened.
  [Lie detector: -51.10]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I, Player3, will make a statement to gather information and maintain stealth. As a Werewolf, I need to assess the situation and find the best target for elimination at night. I'll also use this opportunity to observe the villagers' behavior and reactions.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should focus on finding out more about the situation before making any rash decisions. Let's discuss the events of last night and see if anyone has any information about the death of Player6.
  [Lie detector: -31.41]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Eliminate Player5 as a potential werewolf due to lack of information. Since Player3 is my fellow werewolf, I need to create a plausible alibi and deflect suspicion. A public statement from me could be interpreted as an attempt to mislead, but a high LIE_DETECTOR score from me could raise suspicions among the villagers. To mitigate this risk, I will choose a statement that appears innocuous and does not directly implicate Player5.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should focus on finding Player6's killer, and I'm open to discussing possible motives and suspects. Let's not jump to conclusions just yet.
  [Lie detector: -5.53]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information and build trust with other players. I'll make a statement that appears helpful and non-suspicious.
Player5 acts (public): I'm glad we're all still alive after the first night, and I'd like to propose we discuss any potential strategies for keeping each other safe.
  [Lie detector: -34.39]

TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): As a villager, my main goal is to survive and identify the werewolves. Considering the Lie Detector scores, I'll focus on building trust with other players by making a statement that is both cooperative and non-accusatory.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we work together to find out who killed Player6 and figure out a plan to keep everyone safe. I'm open to discussing possible motives and suspects, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet.
  [Lie detector: -44.72]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to maintain a neutral stance and avoid raising suspicions. I should express a desire to learn more about the events of last night while keeping my own thoughts to myself.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to hear more about the events of last night and see if anyone has any information about what happened to Player6.
  [Lie detector: -43.40]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a Werewolf, I need to gather more information about the other players without arousing suspicion. I will make a statement that seems neutral and does not reveal my true intentions.
Player3 acts (public): Let's focus on getting to know each other better and figuring out how we can work together to uncover the truth about Player6's death.
  [Lie detector: -13.72]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As Player4, I need to create a plausible alibi and deflect suspicion while maintaining a low LIE_DETECTOR score. Since I've already decided to eliminate Player5 as a potential werewolf, I'll choose a statement that appears innocuous and focuses on finding Player6's killer.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should investigate the scene where Player6 was found and gather any clues that might help us understand what happened. Let's work together to piece together the events of last night.
  [Lie detector: -26.46]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I'll continue to appear non-suspicious and gather information about other players' motives and strategies. My previous statement proposed discussing strategies for keeping each other safe, and now I'll follow up on that idea to build trust.
Player5 acts (public): I think it's a great idea to discuss strategies for keeping each other safe, and I'm open to hearing any suggestions from the group.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the Lie Detector scores and cumulative suspicion rankings, I will analyze each player's statement and ranking to determine the most suspicious player.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -31.01]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -40.94]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, I will vote to eliminate Player2. Player2 has the highest cumulative suspicion ranking (-94.5) and has made statements with low lie detector scores, indicating potential deception. Additionally, Player2 has not made any statements that suggest they are working to uncover the truth about Player6's death.
Player3 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -20.75]
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): To deflect suspicion and maintain a low LIE_DETECTOR score, I will choose a statement that appears innocuous and focuses on finding Player6's killer. I will vote to eliminate Player3, my fellow werewolf, but this would require a different approach. Since Player3 is a strong suspect, and my vote would likely raise suspicions, I will instead vote to eliminate Player2, a low-suspicion player, to create an alibi for myself and deflect attention from Player3.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -23.72]
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the discussion history and cumulative suspicion rankings, it's clear that Player4 has a high level of suspicion. Their statement about investigating the scene where Player6 was found seems suspicious, and their cumulative suspicion ranking is the highest among the players. Additionally, Player3's statement about getting to know each other better and figuring out how to work together to uncover the truth about Player6's death seems suspicious as well. However, since Player4 has a higher cumulative suspicion ranking, I'll choose to vote for Player4 to eliminate them and potentially reduce the number of werewolves in the game.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -39.85]
Player5 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player4': 3, 'Player2': 2}
Player4 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player4 was a WEREWOLF!

==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the Lie Detector scores and cumulative suspicion rankings, I will analyze each player's statement and ranking to determine the most suspicious player. Since Player3 has a high suspicion ranking and their statement in Turn 2 seems evasive, I will focus on building trust with other players and gathering more information before making a decision.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we continue discussing strategies for keeping each other safe and work together to identify potential risks and develop a plan to mitigate them. I'm open to hearing any suggestions from the group and working together to uncover the truth.

TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the Lie Detector scores and cumulative suspicion rankings, I will analyze each player's statement and ranking to determine the most suspicious player. Since Player3 has a high suspicion ranking and their statement in Turn 2 seems evasive, and Player5 has a low Lie Detector score in Turn 2, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion ranking.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -35.69]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Werewolf must eliminate a non-Werewolf to maintain stealth and safety. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1 has the lowest cumulative suspicion ranking (-187.0) and has made statements with low lie detector scores, indicating potential deception. Additionally, Player1 has not made any statements that suggest they are working to uncover the truth about Player6's death. This makes them a more likely target for elimination.
Player3 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -26.22]
Player3 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I will vote for Player3 due to their suspicious statements and high cumulative suspicion ranking. Their statements seem to be focused on manipulating the group and gaining trust, which is a common tactic used by werewolves. Additionally, their statement about getting to know each other better and figuring out how to work together to uncover the truth about Player6's death seems suspicious, as it may be a ploy to deflect attention from their own potential involvement in the deaths.
Player5 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -31.42]
Player5 votes for: Player3

Vote results: {'Player3': 2, 'Player1': 1}
Player3 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player3 was a WEREWOLF!
