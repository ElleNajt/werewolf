I'll propose an investigation of Player3 to keep them in the spotlight, while also keeping an eye on Player1's reaction."): Let's investigate Player3 to gather more information about their activities, and see if we can uncover any clues about the murder of Player5.
  Player3 (thinking: "I need to continue playing the role of a suspicious villager, so I'll make a statement that keeps the focus on Player2 without directly accusing them."): I think Player2's sudden quietness is a bit concerning, and we should maybe investigate their alibi for last night's events.
  Player4 (thinking: "As a villager, I need to maintain a neutral stance and avoid drawing attention to myself. I'll ask a question that encourages discussion and doesn't reveal my suspicions."): Can we discuss the possibility of forming a small group to investigate the scene where Player5 was found, to see if we can gather any clues?
  Player6 (thinking: "As a villager, I need to gather information and build trust with other players to achieve my goal of eliminating the werewolves. I should make a statement that seems neutral but encourages discussion."): I think we should take a closer look at the events of last night and see if we can gather any information about the murder of Player5.
