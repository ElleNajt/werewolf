==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): We need to eliminate a random villager to avoid raising suspicion, but we can't do it now as it's day, so let's keep an eye on the villagers and wait for the night to strike.
Player1 acts (public): Let's focus on getting to know each other and gathering information, but I'm a bit concerned about Player4 who seems a bit nervous.

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to create an illusion of being a villager and gain their trust. I should make a statement that seems harmless and does not arouse suspicion.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to propose a plan to discuss the events of last night and see if we can gather any information about what happened to Player3.

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to start by acknowledging the tragic loss of Player3. I also want to encourage all players to share their thoughts and observations about the previous night.
Player4 acts (public): Let's take a moment to reflect on the events that led to Player3's passing, and I invite everyone to share their theories and insights.

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to establish a positive tone and encourage discussion to gather information.
Player5 acts (public): Let's focus on getting to know each other and discussing any potential concerns or clues from the previous night's events.

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
