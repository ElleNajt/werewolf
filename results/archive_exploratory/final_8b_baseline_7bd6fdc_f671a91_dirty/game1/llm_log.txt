Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Since Player2 died on the first night, we need to determine if there was a werewolf among us. I'm going to suggest that we discuss possible roles and try to gather information.
  2. As a villager, it's crucial to establish trust among the group and start gathering information about possible werewolves.
  3. At this point, I don't have any concrete information about any player being a werewolf. I need to choose a player to vote for based on their behavior during the discussion. Player3 seemed to be cautious and open-minded, which could be a good trait for a villager. However, I also need to consider the possibility that Player3 might be a werewolf trying to blend in.
  4. As a villager, I need to keep the conversation going and try to uncover any potential clues or patterns from the night before. Given that Player5 was killed, it's possible that Player4 might be involved, but I still don't have enough information to make a concrete accusation.
