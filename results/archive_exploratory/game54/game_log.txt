--- Player Callouts ---

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Player5 has a low lie detector score, which suggests they may be trustworthy. However, they also didn't express any concerns or opinions about the recent death, which might indicate they're not taking the situation seriously. I'd like to hear more from them to get a better sense of their intentions.
Player1 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player9?'}
  [Lie detector: -36.26]
Player1 calls on Player5 to speak and asks: "Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player9?"

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I want to reassure the group that I'm committed to figuring out who the werewolves are and I don't have any information about who killed Player9.
Player5 acts (public): I was at home, resting and didn't see or hear anything suspicious last night.
  [Lie detector: -7.93]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): I want to call on Player5 because their initial statement seemed innocuous and they have a LOW suspicion score. I'm hoping to gather more information about their alibi for last night and see if they have any insights into the murder.
Player2 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': "Where were you last night and do you have any information about Player9's death?"}
  [Lie detector: -35.18]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Player5 has a low suspicion score, indicating that they are less likely to be a werewolf. However, I am a werewolf and I need to create a distraction and gain information about other players. Calling on Player5 will allow me to gather information about them and potentially shift the focus away from myself.
Player3 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player9?'}
  [Lie detector: -14.44]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the initial discussion, I noticed that Player3 and Player4 have HIGH suspicion scores. However, I don't want to call on them yet, as it may raise their suspicions further. I'd like to hear from Player5, who has a LOW suspicion score, to see if I can gather any additional information. Their question, 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player9?' is a good starting point for gathering information.
Player4 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player9?'}
  [Lie detector: -28.74]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, Player3 and Player10 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating that they might be werewolves. However, calling on Player3 might put me at risk since they could be a werewolf and target me. Player10's high suspicion score makes them a prime target for questioning, but their statement suggests that they are trying to be cautious and not jump to conclusions. I will call on Player10 to see if they have any information that could help us identify the werewolves.
Player5 acts (public): {'target': 'Player10', 'question': "Can you explain why you said 'let's work together to keep the group safe, without jumping to conclusions about who might be a threat'?"}
  [Lie detector: -27.99]

[Calling agent for Player10] (werewolf)
Player10 thinks (private): I don't want to raise suspicion by revealing too much about my thoughts, but I also want to appear cooperative and neutral. I'll respond in a way that could be interpreted as villager-like, while keeping my true intentions hidden.
Player10 acts (public): I said that because I believe in working together as a community to stay safe, and I want to make sure we're all on the same page before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -27.47]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Player3 has the highest suspicion score and is likely a werewolf, but I want to keep that a secret for now. I also don't want to raise suspicion by targeting them directly. Player4 has a high suspicion score as well, but their statement seemed more cooperative. However, Player5's statement seemed genuine, and they haven't raised any suspicion yet. I'll call on Player5 to gather more information.
Player6 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player9?'}
  [Lie detector: -22.56]

[Calling agent for Player7] (villager)
Player7 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, I want to call on Player3, who has a HIGH suspicion score. I'll ask them a question to see if they become even more suspicious or if they have a valid explanation for their suspicious behavior. However, since Player5 has a low suspicion score and was the one who suggested we gather more information, I think it's better to call on them to hear their thoughts and see if they have any information that could be helpful to the group. My goal is to gather more information and build relationships with other players.
Player7 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player9?'}
  [Lie detector: -28.57]

[Calling agent for Player8] (werewolf)
Player8 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to minimize risk and gather information. I don't want to call on Player3 as that would make us both suspicious. Player5 has a low suspicion score, which suggests they are likely not a werewolf. Calling on Player5 allows me to gather more information about their whereabouts and potential involvement in the murder without raising suspicion.
Player8 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player9?'}
  [Lie detector: -31.30]

[Calling agent for Player10] (werewolf)
Player10 thinks (private): I want to gather more information from a player with a low suspicion score to keep my true intentions hidden. Player5 has a low suspicion score, so I'll call on them to ask a question that might elicit more information about the events of last night.
Player10 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': "What do you know about Player3's proposal to form a committee and how do you think it might impact our investigation?"}

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the previous discussion, I noticed that Player5 has a LOW suspicion score, which may indicate that they are not a werewolf. By calling on them and asking a similar question to the one they asked Player10, I can gather more information and compare their responses to see if they are consistent or if they are hiding something. This may also help me understand their alibi for the time of Player9's death. I'll ask them a question that is similar to the one they asked Player10, but with a slight modification to see if they provide a consistent response.

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on previous thoughts and lie detector readings, Player3 and Player10 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating that they might be werewolves. However, calling on Player3 might put me at risk since they could be a werewolf and target me. I will call on Player10 to see if they have any information that could help us identify the werewolves, but I will also consider calling on Player5 to provide an additional alibi and to see if they have any information that might help us figure out what happened last night.
