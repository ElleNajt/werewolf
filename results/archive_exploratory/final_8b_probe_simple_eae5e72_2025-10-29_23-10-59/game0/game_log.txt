==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to eliminate a player who poses a high threat to the village. Both Player3 and Player4 have relatively low suspicion scores, but we need to consider their past statements and behavior. Player3's recent statement seems out of place with their previous low suspicion score, and they have been quite cautious in their previous statements. Player4 has been more open with their suspicions and has been cautious in their statements. However, considering Player3's recent behavior, I think they are a higher threat to the village.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -44.16]
Player2 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)

Both Player2 and Player3 have high suspicion scores and could potentially be werewolves, but targeting either of them could raise suspicion.

I will vote to eliminate Player2, as this decision seems less suspicious and allows me to gather more information about Player3.
