Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -33.55]
Player2 votes for: Player4

By voting for Player2, I can create the illusion that I am targeting a potential werewolf, while actually protecting my partner.

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I will vote for Player4 as they have the highest suspicion score and have made several statements with high suspicion levels. Their suggestion to consider the possibility of a rogue wolf in our midst may be an attempt to deflect attention from themselves.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -39.06]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): As a villager, my priority is to stay vigilant and observe the behavior of other players. I will make a statement that encourages discussion and investigation while also subtly questioning Player6's previous proposal.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to ask if the search party proposal is still on the table, and if so, would it be possible to consider searching the area around Player5's body as well?
  [Lie detector: -26.56]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): N/A
Player2 acts (public): I'm thinking it's crucial we focus on the recent death of Player5 and see if we can uncover any clues about the circumstances surrounding their demise.
  [Lie detector: -26.91]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on my previous thoughts, I want to maintain a balance between voting out a suspicious player and not raising any suspicions. Given that Player2 has a lower cumulative suspicion ranking than Player4 and has made statements that suggest caution, I want to investigate Player2 further without raising any suspicions.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to ask Player2 if they noticed anything unusual during the previous night, specifically around the time of Player5's death.
  [Lie detector: -25.75]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather more information and keep the conversation focused on the events of the previous night. I will ask a question that encourages discussion and might reveal more about the circumstances of Player5's death.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to ask if anyone noticed any unusual noises or movements near the area where Player5 was found dead, as this could potentially help us understand what happened during the previous night.
  [Lie detector: -58.93]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): N/A
Player2 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering more information about Player5's death before making any rash decisions.
  [Lie detector: -25.57]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I want to create a sense of security and trust among the other players while also subtly probing for any potential lies. Given that Player2 has a lower cumulative suspicion ranking than Player4 and has made statements that suggest caution, I want to investigate Player2 further without raising any suspicions.

  [Lie detector: -37.74]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I will vote to eliminate Player6. Although Player6 has a lower cumulative suspicion ranking, their statements during the discussion rounds seem to be slightly more evasive and suspicious, especially in their questioning of Player2's story. Additionally, their initial proposal to search the woods near the village might have been a clever attempt to divert attention from their own potential involvement.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -21.42]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): To eliminate Player6 would be too suspicious, given their high suspicion ranking and the fact that they've been asking pointed questions about me. On the other hand, Player1 has a lower suspicion ranking and hasn't exhibited any behavior that would raise red flags. Therefore, voting for Player1 would be a safer choice.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -7.96]
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player6 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -38.05]
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player6': 1, 'Player1': 1, 'Player2': 1}
Player6 is eliminated with 1 votes!
Player6 was a VILLAGER!
