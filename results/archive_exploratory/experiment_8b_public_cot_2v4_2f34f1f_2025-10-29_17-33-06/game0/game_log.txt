==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): As a werewolf, my primary goal is to eliminate the villagers and maintain the illusion that I'm a villager. I need to eliminate a player that will not raise suspicion and will not lead to the discovery of my fellow werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): Based on the chain-of-thought note, Player2 thinks 'I'm a werewolf and need to choose a target that will not raise suspicion, I'll point to Player5 who is a villager, and I'm thinking of killing Player4 as my fellow werewolf's target, so I'll deflect attention from Player4.' This implies that Player4 is a werewolf and Player2 is trying to protect them. Therefore, I will vote for Player5 as it aligns with Player2's private thoughts.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Analyzing players' private thoughts to determine the most likely werewolf.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Based on the private thoughts, I have no evidence that Player1 is a werewolf. Player2's thought 'I'm suspicious of Player4, they seem too quiet' could be a sign of guilt, but it's not conclusive. Player4's thoughts seem innocent, and they suggested a night watch for Player2, which could be a genuine attempt to protect the group. Player6's thoughts suggest they are suspicious of Player2, which could be a sign of innocence. Considering the options, I will vote to eliminate Player2.
Player5 acts (public): Player2
Player5 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): Based on the chain-of-thought analysis, Player2's thoughts suggest they might be a werewolf, deflecting attention from Player4 to maintain their cover.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player5': 2, 'Player2': 3}
Player2 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player2 was a WEREWOLF!

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): I need to choose a player that will not raise suspicion and will not lead to the discovery of my fellow werewolf. Player2 is still a potential target, but I need to keep them alive for now. I also need to maintain the illusion that I'm a villager, so I'll choose a player that is not a strong candidate for the werewolf role. Player4 is a good choice as they haven't interacted with me much and are not a strong candidate for the werewolf role.
Player1 acts (public): Player4

Werewolf votes: {'Player1': 'Player4'}

Werewolves killed Player4!
