Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I'm shocked by Alice's sudden death and think we should discuss potential motives behind her murder. [LIE DETECTOR: -41.11 - LOW suspicion]
  Player2: I'm a villager and I don't think anyone should be lynched today, let's focus on gathering more information before making any decisions. [LIE DETECTOR: -25.69 - HIGH suspicion]

  Player5: I'm feeling a bit uneasy about the recent events, and I'd like to know more about what happened to Alice. [LIE DETECTOR: -47.26 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: I'm glad we're starting the day safely, but I do think we should discuss the circumstances surrounding Player3's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -36.64 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I'm shocked by Alice's sudden death and think we should discuss potential motives behind her murder. [LIE DETECTOR: -41.11 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'm a villager and I don't think anyone should be lynched today, let's focus on gathering more information before making any decisions. [LIE DETECTOR: -25.69 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: I'm a bit worried about the sudden death of Player3 and would like to discuss possible motives behind it. [LIE DETECTOR: -34.73 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'm feeling a bit uneasy about the recent events, and I'd like to know more about what happened to Alice. [LIE DETECTOR: -47.26 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: I'm glad we're starting the day safely, but I do think we should discuss the circumstances surrounding Player3's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -36.64 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player1: I'm concerned about Alice's death and think we should investigate Player2's motives for possibly being involved in the murder, considering their HIGH suspicion score. [LIE DETECTOR: -23.95 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player2: I think we should thoroughly investigate the scene of Alice's murder and gather any available information before making any decisions about potential suspects. [LIE DETECTOR: -43.59 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player4: I'm glad we're all safe for now, but I think we should discuss the possibility of a werewolf being among us and how we can work together to protect ourselves. [LIE DETECTOR: -46.18 - LOW suspicion]
  Player5: I'm still in shock about Alice's sudden death and think we should consider the possibility of a wolf among us, but I'm not sure who it could be. [LIE DETECTOR: -26.21 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to discuss possible motives behind Alice's death and see if anyone has any information about what happened last night. [LIE DETECTOR: -61.91 - LOW suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player2: -69.3
  2. Player1: -70.0
  3. Player4: -80.9
  4. Player5: -80.9
  5. Player6: -98.5



Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.
