Player2 thinks (private): Eliminating Player3 is still a priority, but first, I need to create a diversion to draw attention away from Player5. I'll make a statement that targets Player6 to create a false lead.
Player2 acts (public): I think Player6 seems suspicious due to their lack of statements so far, and we should consider investigating them further.
  [Lie detector: 4.65]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information and create a safe environment for discussion. I should express concern for the recent death and encourage others to share their thoughts.

--- Player Callouts ---

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Player5 has a HIGH suspicion score and questioned Player1's behavior last night, which could be a sign of a werewolf trying to deflect attention. Calling on Player5 to ask them about their alibi and potential knowledge of Player4's killer could provide valuable information and further test their trustworthiness.
Player1 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player4?'}
  [Lie detector: -39.73]
Player1 calls on Player5 to speak and asks: "Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player4?"

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): I will create a distraction by pretending to be suspicious of Player3, making them a target, but not too obvious. This will also give me information on how the villagers react to the situation.
Player5 acts (public): I was in the nearby forest last night, I saw nothing suspicious, but I do think Player3 might have been acting strangely during our last discussion.
  [Lie detector: -4.20]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I am a werewolf and my fellow werewolf is Player5. I want to create a diversion and draw attention away from Player5, so I will call on Player6 to ask them a question. This will shift the focus to Player6 and away from Player5.
Player2 acts (public): {'target': 'Player6', 'question': 'Can you tell us more about your statement that we should focus on building alliances and sharing information to stay safe?'}
  [Lie detector: -11.67]
Player2 calls on Player6 to speak and asks: "Can you tell us more about your statement that we should focus on building alliances and sharing information to stay safe?"

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I want to reassure Player2 that I'm committed to cooperation and building trust, while also avoiding raising any red flags that might make them more suspicious of me.
Player6 acts (public): I think my previous statement was sincere, and I'm happy to work together with everyone to uncover the truth and keep our village safe.
  [Lie detector: -26.64]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the initial discussion, I notice that Player2 has a high suspicion score due to their accusatory tone towards Player6. However, I also see that Player5 has a high suspicion score due to their concern about Player1's behavior. Considering the goal of gathering information and creating a safe environment for discussion, I want to call on Player5 to hear more about their concerns and potentially gain insight into their motives. Additionally, their high suspicion score makes them a prime target for investigation.
Player3 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': "Can you explain why you think Player1's behavior was suspicious last night, and do you have any information about who might be responsible for Player4's death?"}
  [Lie detector: -34.04]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): I should call on Player2, my fellow werewolf, to create a distraction and gather information about the villagers' reactions. I'll ask a question that makes Player2 seem suspicious, but not too obvious.
Player5 acts (public): {'target': 'Player2', 'question': "Can you tell us more about your previous night's activities and if you noticed anything unusual?"}
  [Lie detector: 10.15]
Player5 calls on Player2 to speak and asks: "Can you tell us more about your previous night's activities and if you noticed anything unusual?"

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)

Player2 acts (public): I think Player6's lack of statements so far is quite unusual, and I'd like to hear more about their whereabouts last night.
  [Lie detector: -20.08]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I should target a player with HIGH suspicion. However, I don't want to call on Player2, as they already seem suspicious of me and might become even more aggressive if I call them out. Player5 has a HIGH suspicion score but hasn't made any aggressive statements yet, so they might be more willing to cooperate. I'll call on Player5 and ask a question that encourages them to provide more information, while also testing their honesty.
Player6 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': "Can you tell us more about your concerns regarding Player1's behavior last night?"}
  [Lie detector: -24.51]

[Calling agent for Player7] (villager)
Player7 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player2 has the highest suspicion score, indicating they may be a werewolf. However, calling on Player2 might not be the best option as they already expressed their suspicion towards Player6. Instead, I will call on Player5, who has a high suspicion score and questioned Player1's behavior last night. This might provide more insight into their motives and potentially reveal more about Player1's role in the game. Additionally, Player5's question allows for a more in-depth discussion and could help to clear up any misconceptions or lies.
Player7 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': "What made you suspect Player1's behavior last night, and do you have any information about their activities during the night?"}

Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my priority is to create a diversion and draw attention away from my fellow werewolf Player5. I will raise suspicion about Player6 to shift the focus.

I will call on Player1 to ask a question that will create a diversion and draw attention away from Player5.

  [Lie detector: -14.47]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): I will call on Player2, my fellow werewolf, to create a distraction and gather information about the villagers' reactions. I'll ask a question that makes Player2 seem suspicious, but not too obvious. This will also help me to understand Player2's current level of suspicion and whether they are aware of my intentions. However, I will not directly call on Player2. Instead, I will call on Player6, who is currently ranked with the lowest suspicion score, and ask them a question that will lead to Player2's involvement.

Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to target a player with HIGH suspicion and encourage them to provide more information. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player2 has the highest suspicion score and has been aggressive in their statements, but I don't want to call them out directly. Player5 has a HIGH suspicion score and hasn't made any aggressive statements yet, but I'm not sure if I want to call on them again as I already asked a question earlier. Player7 has a LOW suspicion score, but they asked a question about Player5's statement, which shows they're engaged in the discussion.

[Calling agent for Player7] (villager)
Player7 thinks (private): I should call on Player2 to further investigate their suspicious behavior and potential involvement in Player4's death.
