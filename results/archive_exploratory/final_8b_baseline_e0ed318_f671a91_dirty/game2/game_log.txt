--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to create an alibi and gain trust from the villagers, while also trying to figure out who the other werewolf is.
Player1 acts (public): I propose we discuss the possibility of Player3's death being a result of a rogue player, and that we should work together to find the true culprit.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gather information and not raise any suspicion. I will make a statement that seems neutral and doesn't reveal too much.
Player2 acts (public): Let's discuss how we can work together to keep everyone safe and figure out who might be a threat to us.

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): We should eliminate a player with the most potential to discover our team's existence to prevent early detection, and Player2 seems like a good target due to their potential to investigate or gather information.
Player4 acts (public): I suggest we lynch Player2, as they might be a potential threat to our secrecy.

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information and build trust with other players. I'll make a statement that encourages collaboration and discussion.
Player5 acts (public): Let's work together to uncover the truth and protect our village. Who can we trust, and what do we need to do to stay safe?

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information and build trust with other players. Since Player3 was killed on the first night, it's likely that one of the remaining players is a werewolf.
Player6 acts (public): I propose we discuss the events of the previous night and try to figure out who might be responsible for Player3's death.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to eliminate a villager to maintain the balance of power, but I must also create an alibi and gain trust from the villagers. Since Player4 is my fellow werewolf, I should not vote for them. I should also avoid voting for Player1, as they might be suspicious of my actions. Between Player2, Player5, and Player6, I need to choose one that will not raise suspicions and will allow me to maintain my alibi.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): I will vote for Player4, as their suggestion to lynch me raises suspicion and may indicate that they are not genuinely working with the group.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Eliminate a player with the most potential to discover our team's existence to prevent early detection.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the discussion, I see that Player4 suggested lynching Player2, which seems suspicious. I also notice that Player1 suggested lynching Player6, but Player1's initial proposal was to work together, which aligns with my goal of gathering information and building trust.
Player5 acts (public): Player2
Player5 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I will vote for Player4 because their suggestion to lynch Player2 seems suspicious, and it could be a distraction tactic to divert attention from themselves.
Player6 acts (public): Player4
Player6 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player2': 3, 'Player4': 2}
Player2 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player2 was a VILLAGER!
