  Player6: I'd like to suggest we start by gathering information about Player5's last actions and words before their death.
  Player1: I think we should focus on building a strong coalition and gathering information about each other's actions and words before making any accusations. This will help us make informed decisions and stay one step ahead of any potential threats.
  Player2: I'd like to propose that we work together to investigate Player5's death and gather more information before making any accusations, while also keeping an open mind about the possibilities and potential roles of the other players.
  Player3: I'd like to welcome everyone to the game and propose that we work together to gather information and share our thoughts, so we can all make informed decisions about how to proceed.
  Player4: I'd like to propose that we work together to gather more information about Player5's death and figure out the best course of action to ensure our safety and well-being.
  Player6: I think we should focus on gathering information about Player5's last actions and words before their death, and also consider discussing our roles and strategies to figure out what happened.




Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Minimal risk to reveal our existence, no prior knowledge of player alignment
  2. We should not reveal our existence yet, so I'll make a neutral statement to avoid drawing attention.
  3. Neutral statement to avoid drawing attention and maintain the werewolf's existence secret for now.

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
{
  "reasoning": "Vote analysis: Considering our role as a werewolf and the goal to maintain secrecy, I will choose a player that is less likely to suspect our existence. Player4 is a fellow werewolf, and voting for them may raise suspicion. Player1, Player2, and Player3 are all villagers, but they seem to be open to discussion and coalition-building. To avoid drawing attention, I will vote for a player that seems cautious and less likely to be a werewolf.",
