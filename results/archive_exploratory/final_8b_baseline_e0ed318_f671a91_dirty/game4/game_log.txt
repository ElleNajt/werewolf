TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to know more about the player who was killed last night and if there's any suspicious behavior from the remaining players.
Player1 acts (public): I suggest we talk about Player2's actions and behavior before they were killed, and also discuss any potential motives or clues that might have led to their death.
