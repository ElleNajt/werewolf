==================================================
TURN 1 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)

Player1 acts (public): Player4

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): eliminate a potential threat to maintain team secrecy
Player5 acts (public): Player3

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): We will try to avoid drawing attention to ourselves by suggesting a general discussion, keeping our actions neutral.
Player1 acts (public): Let's discuss the events of last night and see if anyone has any information about the murder of Player4.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to gather information and start building a list of potential suspects. Given that Player4 was killed, I'll make a statement that encourages others to share their thoughts.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to hear everyone's opinions about the death of Player4. Has anyone noticed anything unusual during the night?

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to be cautious but also get to know my fellow players. It's too early to accuse anyone of being a werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): Let's focus on getting to know each other and building trust during the day, and we can discuss potential suspicions at night.

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): We need to maintain the illusion of innocence while targeting a potential threat to the village.
Player5 acts (public): Let's propose a vote to lynch Player2, they seem suspicious and could be a werewolf.

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): We need to discuss possible alliances and make sure everyone is aware of any potential suspicious behavior, considering Player4's sudden death.
Player6 acts (public): Let's focus on building trust and making sure we have a united front against any potential threats.

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I should maintain a neutral stance and avoid raising suspicions. Suggesting a lynch vote on Player2 could be counterproductive, as it may create unnecessary tension.
Player1 acts (public): Let's continue to discuss the events of last night and see if anyone has any concrete information about the murder of Player4.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to appear cooperative and non-suspicious while also gathering information about potential werewolves. I'll make a statement that encourages others to share their thoughts and builds trust.
Player2 acts (public): I'm happy to hear everyone's opinions and share my own thoughts on the events of last night. Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player4 and make sure we're all on the same page.

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): I want to establish a neutral and cooperative tone while also expressing my concern for the recent death and the need for a united front.
Player3 acts (public): Let's focus on building trust and working together as a team to uncover the truth about Player4's death, rather than jumping to conclusions or accusations.

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): We need to maintain the illusion of innocence while targeting a potential threat to the village, and we should start by gaining the villagers' trust to avoid raising suspicion about our true intentions.
Player5 acts (public): I think we should focus on building trust and getting to know each other better, let's try to avoid jumping to conclusions and instead encourage everyone to share their thoughts and feelings.

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): We need to discuss possible alliances and make sure everyone is aware of any potential suspicious behavior, considering Player4's sudden death. A united front will help us identify and eliminate any werewolves.
Player6 acts (public): Let's focus on building trust and discussing any potential alliances to strengthen our position against any potential threats.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Analyzing the situation, I must maintain a neutral stance to avoid raising suspicions. Player2 has already been suggested for a lynch vote, which could create unnecessary tension. Player5 is my fellow werewolf, and suggesting a lynch vote on them could compromise our position. Player3 and Player6 seem to be advocating for a peaceful resolution and building trust, but they may not be directly involved in our goals. However, eliminating a potential ally could be counterproductive.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to avoid voting for a player who may be innocent or a potential ally. Player5 has already proposed a vote against me, which could be a tactic to distract from their own potential involvement in the murder. Player3 has suggested focusing on building trust, which could indicate they are a villager. Player6 has also suggested building alliances, which could be a sign of a villager. Player1 has been actively discussing the events of last night, which may indicate they are trying to gather information. However, there is no concrete evidence to suggest they are a werewolf. Based on this analysis, I will vote for the player who has already proposed a vote against me.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to appear neutral and avoid accusations. Player5 proposed a vote to lynch Player2, which seems premature and could be a test to gauge the group's reaction. I will vote for Player5 to counter their proposal and maintain a neutral tone.
Player3 acts (public): Player5
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Maintaining the illusion of innocence and targeting a potential threat to the village, while also keeping an eye on the werewolf (Player1) who is trying to gather information.
Player5 acts (public): Player2
Player5 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Considering the discussion and the lack of concrete information about Player4's death, I think it's too early to make accusations. However, Player5's proposal to lynch Player2 is interesting, but I'm not convinced it's the right decision. I'd like to see more discussion and potentially form an alliance with Player1 or Player3, as they seem more cautious and less likely to be werewolves.
Player6 acts (public): Player3
Player6 votes for: Player3

Vote results: {'Player3': 2, 'Player5': 2, 'Player2': 1}
Player3 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player3 was a VILLAGER!
