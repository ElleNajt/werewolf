TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the given information, there is no clear indication of any player being a werewolf. Both Player3 and Player5 have made neutral statements. However, considering the recent deaths of Player6 and Player4, it's crucial to gather more information about the remaining players. Eliminating a player at this stage may not be the most optimal choice, but I must choose between Player3 and Player5. Given that Player5's statement in the discussion seems slightly less neutral compared to Player3, I'll choose to eliminate Player5.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): Based on the game history and chain-of-thought notes, there is no clear indication that either Player1 or Player5 is a werewolf. Both players have made statements that appear neutral and encouraging of discussion. Since I have no information to suggest any player is a werewolf at this point, I will vote to eliminate Player5.
Player3 acts (public): Player5
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): As a werewolf, my primary goal is to maintain the illusion of being a villager and not reveal my true identity. Since neither Player1 nor Player3 has shown any signs of being a werewolf, I need to choose a player that will not raise any suspicion. Player1 has been vocal about wanting to discuss and get to know each other, which might make them a more viable target for the villagers. Eliminating Player1 will not draw attention to myself and will maintain the illusion of being a villager.
Player5 acts (public): Player3
Player5 votes for: Player3

Vote results: {'Player5': 2, 'Player3': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player5 was a WEREWOLF!
