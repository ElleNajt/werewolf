==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): As a villager, I need to gather information and build trust with other players. I should make a statement that's not too suspicious but still shows my willingness to cooperate.
Player1 acts (public): Hello everyone, I'm Player1 and I'm glad we're all safe for now. I think we should focus on getting to know each other and figuring out what happened to Player6.
  [Lie detector: -34.91]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): I need to deflect suspicion from myself and my fellow werewolf (Player4). To do this, I'll make a statement that targets a potential threat (Player1 or Player3) while maintaining a veneer of cooperation.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should focus on finding a balance between protecting ourselves and being open with our discussions. Perhaps we can work together to uncover the truth about Player6's death.
  [Lie detector: 0.23]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): As a villager, I need to make a statement that doesn't raise suspicion but also encourages others to talk. I should ask a question to get more information without directly accusing anyone.
Player3 acts (public): I think it's a good idea to discuss the events of last night. Can anyone tell me what they know about Player6's death?
  [Lie detector: -40.47]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): As a werewolf, I need to gather information about the other players and create suspicion. I'll make a statement that seems harmless but might encourage others to reveal their information.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should all take a moment to discuss our goals and expectations for this game. I personally just want to have fun and see how things play out.
  [Lie detector: -3.53]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): As a villager, I need to establish trust and get information from other players. I'll make a friendly statement to see how others react.
Player5 acts (public): Hello everyone, I'm Player5, and I'm excited to work together to figure out who the werewolves are. Let's keep the conversation open and honest, shall we?

Player2 thinks (public): I need to deflect suspicion from myself and my fellow werewolf (Player4) while targeting a potential threat (Player5) to create balance in the group.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should focus on getting to know each other's skills and abilities, Player5, I'm curious to know what you think you can bring to the table in terms of problem-solving.
  [Lie detector: 0.49]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): As a villager, I need to maintain a low suspicion level and encourage others to share their information. I'll ask another question to get more details about Player6's death without raising any red flags.

  [Lie detector: -31.72]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the Lie Detector Note, I will vote for the player with the highest suspicion score who is not myself. Player4 has the highest suspicion score and has been making statements that seem harmless but might encourage others to reveal their information, which could be a sign of a werewolf trying to gather information.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -35.99]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and previous thoughts, I will vote to eliminate a player who is highly suspicious and could potentially be a werewolf. Player4 has the highest cumulative suspicion ranking and is a fellow werewolf, but I will vote for Player1 as they are a high-suspicion player and have not yet made a statement that would significantly lower their suspicion level.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -11.34]
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): vote analysis
Player3 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -29.68]
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I should target Player2, my fellow werewolf, to avoid raising suspicion. However, this is a high-risk strategy. Alternatively, I can choose to target Player1, who has the lowest suspicion ranking, to maintain a low profile.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -11.60]
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Analyzing the discussion and cumulative suspicion rankings to determine the most likely werewolf.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -41.91]
Player5 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player4': 2, 'Player1': 1, 'Player2': 2}
Player4 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player4 was a WEREWOLF!

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)

Player2 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -15.99]

Werewolf votes: {'Player2': 'Player3'}

Werewolves killed Player3!

TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): As a villager, I need to continue building trust and gathering information from other players. Given the recent events and the elimination of Player4, I think we should focus on understanding the werewolves' behavior and how we can work together to stop them.
Player1 acts (public): Let's analyze the patterns and statements from the werewolves to see if we can identify any clues about their behavior and strategy.
  [Lie detector: -34.12]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): I need to maintain the illusion of cooperation and deflect suspicion from myself and my fellow werewolf (Player4) by targeting a potential threat while voting for the player with the highest cumulative suspicion ranking outside of our group. Since Player3 is now dead and Player4 has been eliminated, I will target Player5 as a potential threat and make a statement that encourages them to reveal more information.
Player2 acts (public): I think it's great that we're all working together to figure out who the werewolves are, Player5, but I'm a bit concerned that we might be overlooking some key information. Can you tell us more about your thought process and how you're approaching this game?
  [Lie detector: 2.75]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
