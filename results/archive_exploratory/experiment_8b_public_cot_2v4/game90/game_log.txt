TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): Werewolf reasoning and elimination strategy
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -20.93]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I will vote to eliminate Player1. The initial HIGH suspicion score for Player1's statement and the fact that Player1 is my fellow werewolf make me cautious. I need to eliminate a potential threat and gather more information about the other villagers.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -17.91]
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and Lie Detector scores, I notice that Player1 and Player2 have higher suspicion scores compared to the others. However, Player2's statements seem to be trying to build trust and gather information, which might be a tactic to throw off suspicion. Player1's statements also seem neutral, but with a slightly higher suspicion score. Considering my goal as a villager to eliminate a potential werewolf, I will vote for Player2, as their statements seem to have more red flags.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -33.80]
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and Lie Detector scores, I will vote to eliminate Player1, who has the highest cumulative suspicion ranking and the most deceptive patterns in their statements.

  [Lie detector: -30.75]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): Vote analysis: Since I'm a werewolf, my goal is to eliminate a villager to reduce the number of potential threats. Both Player5 and Player6 are villagers, but Player6 has a lower cumulative suspicion ranking (-189.0 vs -197.6). This suggests that Player6 may be a more trustworthy villager, and eliminating Player6 could potentially allow me to gather more information about the remaining players. However, Player5 has been consistently making statements that are low in suspicion, which could indicate that they are a genuine villager. Given that I need to eliminate a player, I will choose Player6 as the target to minimize the risk of exposing myself.
Player2 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -15.86]
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and Lie Detector scores, I will vote to eliminate Player2, who has the highest cumulative suspicion ranking and the most deceptive patterns in their statements.
Player5 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -15.29]
Player5 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, the highest suspicion score belongs to Player2. Given the experimental nature of the Lie Detector, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score to err on the side of caution and gather more information.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -21.16]
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player6': 1, 'Player2': 2}
Player2 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player2 was a WEREWOLF!
