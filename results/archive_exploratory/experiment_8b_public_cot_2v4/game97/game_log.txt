TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings and the experimental lie detector results, Player4 has a high suspicion score (-1.05) and made a statement that seems suspicious, attempting to shift attention to Player2. To maintain the illusion of a werewolf partnership, I will vote to eliminate Player2, creating an opportunity for Player4 to act during the night phase.

  [Lie detector: -33.06]
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player4 are the most suspicious players. However, as a villager, I need to eliminate one player without giving away my own innocence. Considering the discussion history, Player1's suspicious statements and high cumulative suspicion score make them a stronger candidate for elimination.

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)

In this case, Player2 is still a strong candidate to be a seer or have a role that could impact the game.

Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on the previous game history and cumulative suspicion rankings, both Player3 and Player5 have LOW suspicion scores. However, considering the werewolf's strategy to eliminate a player with the most information or potential to gain information, and maintaining the cover of a villager concerned about the safety of the group, it's essential to make a decision that aligns with these goals. In this case, I will choose to vote for Player5, as their LOW suspicion score may indicate they are a villager, and eliminating them would not significantly impact the game. On the other hand, Player3 has a slightly higher suspicion score, but it's still relatively LOW, making them a less likely target for the werewolf. However, considering the werewolf's goal of maintaining the cover of a villager, it's essential to make a decision that does not raise significant suspicion. Therefore, I will vote for Player5.
