==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): As a villager, I need to start gathering information about the remaining players. Since Player4 was killed at night, I should try to get a feel for who might have done it.
Player1 acts (public): I'm curious to know, have any of you seen or heard anything unusual last night, like someone acting suspiciously or making strange noises?
  [Lie detector: -38.43]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): As a villager, I need to appear concerned and try to gather information from other players. I will make a statement that is not too revealing but seems innocent and cooperative.
Player2 acts (public): I'm shocked to hear that Player4 was killed. We need to figure out who's behind this and make sure we're all safe.
  [Lie detector: -46.55]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): As a villager, I need to gather information and assess potential werewolves. I'll make a statement that encourages discussion and scrutiny of Player6, who I haven't seen interacting much yet.
Player3 acts (public): I think it's suspicious that Player6 hasn't said anything about Player4's death yet, and I'd like to hear their thoughts on the matter.
  [Lie detector: -36.33]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): To gain an advantage, I need to appear cooperative and non-threatening. I will express concern for the recent death and suggest a strategy to ensure safety.
Player5 acts (public): I'm concerned about the recent death, and I think we should discuss the possibility of a traitor among us. We should work together to establish a safe routine and watch each other's backs.
  [Lie detector: -37.35]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): As a werewolf, I must be cautious and avoid raising suspicion. I'll make a statement that seems innocuous and may even shift attention to another player.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to discuss the recent death of Player4. Perhaps we can investigate their actions during the night to gather more information.
  [Lie detector: -21.70]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): As a villager, I need to continue gathering information and assessing potential werewolves. I'll make a statement that seems cooperative and encourages discussion, but also subtly targets Player6.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should discuss the recent death of Player4 in more detail and see if anyone has any information about their actions during the night, perhaps we can even ask Player6 if they noticed anything unusual.
  [Lie detector: -36.15]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): As a villager, I want to maintain a low suspicion level and appear cooperative. I will build upon Player3's suggestion to scrutinize Player6, but in a way that seems non-threatening.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to hear more about Player6's thoughts on the recent death, and perhaps we can discuss how we can all work together to ensure our safety.
  [Lie detector: -40.29]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): I will build on my previous statement and further scrutinize Player6's behavior, trying to understand why they haven't spoken up yet.
Player3 acts (public): I think it's still suspicious that Player6 hasn't said anything about Player4's death yet, and I'd like to hear their thoughts on the matter, especially considering their lack of interaction so far.
  [Lie detector: -53.36]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): As a werewolf, my goal is to avoid raising suspicion and gain the trust of the villagers. I will make a statement that appears cooperative and non-threatening, while also subtly shifting attention away from myself and towards another player.
Player5 acts (public): I'm concerned about the recent death, and I think we should discuss the possibility of a traitor among us. I'd like to propose that we focus on gathering more information about Player3, who seemed a bit suspicious with their comment about Player6.
  [Lie detector: -13.61]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): I must continue to appear cooperative and cautious, shifting attention away from myself and onto other players. I'll make a statement that seems innocuous and may even encourage the villagers to scrutinize Player3.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should focus on discussing Player3's behavior, as they seemed quite suspicious in their previous statement about my inactivity.

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, the most suspicious player is Player6 with a score of -33.6, followed closely by Player5 with a score of -82.8. However, the discussion history suggests that Player5 has been trying to shift attention away from themselves and towards other players.
