TURN 1 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)

  [Lie detector: -27.52]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)

TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player4 has a HIGH suspicion score and has made multiple statements with HIGH suspicion levels, indicating potential deception.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -3.67]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): As a werewolf, I need to eliminate a player who poses a threat to my survival or one who might be a strong villager. In this case, Player1 has been consistently building trust and has a lower suspicion score, making them a potential target. However, Player5 has a lower suspicion score as well, and eliminating them might raise suspicion about my own identity. Considering the situation, I will vote to eliminate Player5, as they are less likely to be a strong villager and might be a weaker target.
