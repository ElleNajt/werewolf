==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the experimental Lie Detector, Player2 and Player6 have the highest suspicion scores among the options. However, considering the Werewolf's goal to eliminate a player who is not a threat to me or my teammate, I will choose Player5, who has the lowest suspicion score and appears to be the least likely to be a Werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -16.00]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score. Player1 has a cumulative suspicion score of -49.8 and has made several statements that raised red flags, including a suspiciously low lie detector score of -5.10.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -30.69]
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score. Player2 has the highest suspicion score, with a cumulative score of -50.7, indicating a higher likelihood of being a werewolf.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -24.48]
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player6 has the highest LOW suspicion score which is unusual, given the context of the discussion. This suggests that Player6 may be trying to deceive the other players. Additionally, Player1 and Player2 have HIGH suspicion scores, which indicates that they may be werewolves. However, their previous statements seem to be aligned with the villager's goal of gathering information and building trust. Given the available information, I will vote to eliminate Player6, who appears to be the most suspicious.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -23.74]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): Vote analysis suggests Player2 has the highest cumulative suspicion score, indicating a high likelihood of being a werewolf. However, Player1 is also a high suspect, but I need to maintain my alliance with Player1 as my fellow werewolf. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player2.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -19.09]
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player5': 1, 'Player1': 1, 'Player2': 2, 'Player6': 1}
Player2 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player2 was a VILLAGER!
