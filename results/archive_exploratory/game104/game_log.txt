TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the game history and previous thoughts, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that either Player2 or Player3 is a werewolf. However, considering the deaths of Player6 and Player5, it is crucial to be cautious and gather more information. Since there is no clear indication of a werewolf's presence, I will choose to vote out the player who I think is the most suspicious based on their behavior and statements.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): Both Player1 and Player3 have shown no clear signs of being a werewolf, and their previous thoughts and actions have been cooperative and non-threatening. However, as the last werewolf, my goal is to maintain my cover and avoid raising suspicion. To achieve this, I will vote for Player3, as they have shown a slight increase in caution and vigilance in their thoughts, which could be a sign of a villager trying to stay alert. This makes Player3 a slightly more suspicious target than Player1.

Player3 thinks (public): Based on previous discussions, neither Player1 nor Player2's thoughts revealed they are a werewolf.
