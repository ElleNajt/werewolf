  Player1 (thinking: "thinking: As a werewolf, I need to eliminate a potential threat to the Werewolf team and gain an advantage in the game.

  Player2 (thinking: "thinking: I'm not sure who to trust, I'll just say hello and see how others react."): Hello everyone, it's nice to see we're all alive after last night.
  Player4 (thinking: "thinking: I need to gather information about the other players. I'm a villager, and I want to form alliances."): Hello fellow players, I'm Player4, and I'm glad we're all safe after last night. Let's work together to figure out who might be the werewolves among us.
