Night: Player3 was killed.

{"reasoning": "Based on the game history, no player has revealed themselves as a werewolf. I will analyze the players' statements and look for any suspicious behavior or language that might indicate a werewolf. Player1 and Player2 seem to be maintaining a neutral image, while Player5 and Player6 are focusing on getting to know each other and gathering information. Considering my previous thoughts, I will look for any potential leads or clues that might indicate who the werewolves are among us. Since I don't have any concrete evidence, I will vote for a player who seems to be being overly cautious or evasive.", "action": "Player2"}
