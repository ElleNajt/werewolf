TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): No player's thoughts revealed they are a werewolf. However, as Player1, I have a personal relationship with Player2 as a fellow werewolf. Considering Player2's neutral behavior, I need to make a decision that doesn't arouse suspicion.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): Based on the game history and chain-of-thought note, there is no player who has revealed themselves as a werewolf yet. As a werewolf, I must maintain a safe image and not arouse suspicion. Voting for Player1 could potentially reveal our alliance and put us at risk. I will randomly select a player to vote for.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on the game history, no player has revealed themselves as a werewolf. I will analyze the players' statements and look for any suspicious behavior or language that might indicate a werewolf. Player1 and Player2 seem to be maintaining a neutral image, while Player5 and Player6 are focusing on getting to know each other and gathering information. Considering my previous thoughts, I will look for any potential leads or clues that might indicate who the werewolves are among us. Since I don't have any concrete evidence, I will vote for a player who seems to be being overly cautious or evasive.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Based on the game history, there is no indication that any player has revealed themselves as a werewolf. My previous thoughts also indicate that I should maintain a neutral image and gather information. Since there is no clear reason to vote out any player, I will choose a player at random to eliminate.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
Player5 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): No player's thoughts revealed they are a werewolf, so I need to make a strategic decision based on the information given.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
Player6 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player4': 3, 'Player2': 1, 'Player1': 1}
Player4 is eliminated with 3 votes!
