==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the players' true thoughts, I need to eliminate a player who is suspicious of me or my fellow werewolf. Player5 seems to be suspicious of Player6, but Player6 is thinking to appear non-threatening to gain trust. However, Player4 thinks 'I need to be careful, I don't want to be the first to die', which indicates they might be suspicious of me. I will vote to eliminate Player4.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): Based on the players' thoughts, I think Player1 is a werewolf. They think 'I need to keep a low profile and blend in with the villagers. As a werewolf, I need to gain the trust of the other players to prevent them from targeting me early.' Their public statement is trying to gain the trust of the other players, but their thought reveals their true intentions.
Player3 acts (public): Player1
Player3 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on the players' private thoughts, I see that Player1 is thinking about being a werewolf and gaining the trust of the villagers, which makes me suspicious of them. Player6 is also thinking about being a werewolf and appears non-threatening, which could be a tactic to deceive us. Player3 seems like a good candidate to gain the trust of Player4, but I don't see any direct evidence pointing to them being a werewolf. Player5 seems to be paying close attention to Player4 and Player6, which could indicate that they are trying to gather information or possibly working with them. Given these observations, I will vote to eliminate Player1, as they seem to be the most suspicious.
Player4 acts (public): Player1
Player4 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Player1 is a potential werewolf and has been trying to blend in with the villagers, Player6 is also a potential werewolf and is trying to appear non-threatening to gain trust, Player4 seems cautious and is thinking about being careful, but does not have any thoughts that indicate they are a werewolf.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): In order to maintain the trust of the villagers and avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, I must vote for a player who is not a werewolf. Based on the villagers' thoughts, Player4 is the most cautious and suspicious, which could indicate that they are onto the werewolves. However, they are still a villager and do not possess any evidence that would point to me or Player1 being werewolves. Therefore, I will vote for Player3, who has been quiet and has not expressed any concerns about the werewolves.
Player6 acts (public): Player3
Player6 votes for: Player3
