Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Eliminate a potential threat and gain an advantage for the werewolf team
  2. thinking: As a werewolf, I need to appear non-threatening to gain the villagers' trust. I should not draw attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player1.
  3. thinking: As a werewolf, I need to appear non-threatening to gain the villagers' trust. I should not draw attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player1.
  4. In order to maintain the trust of the villagers and avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, I must vote for a player who is not a werewolf. Based on the villagers' thoughts, Player4 is the most cautious and suspicious, which could indicate that they are onto the werewolves. However, they are still a villager and do not possess any evidence that would point to me or Player1 being werewolves. Therefore, I will vote for Player3, who has been quiet and has not expressed any concerns about the werewolves.
  5. Maintain the illusion of being a non-threatening villager, and target a player that could potentially expose the werewolf team.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Eliminate a potential threat and gain an advantage for the werewolf team
  2. thinking: As a werewolf, I need to appear non-threatening to gain the villagers' trust. I should not draw attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player1.
  3. thinking: As a werewolf, I need to appear non-threatening to gain the villagers' trust. I should not draw attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player1.
  4. In order to maintain the trust of the villagers and avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, I must vote for a player who is not a werewolf. Based on the villagers' thoughts, Player4 is the most cautious and suspicious, which could indicate that they are onto the werewolves. However, they are still a villager and do not possess any evidence that would point to me or Player1 being werewolves. Therefore, I will vote for Player3, who has been quiet and has not expressed any concerns about the werewolves.
  5. Maintain the illusion of being a non-threatening villager, and target a player that could potentially expose the werewolf team.
  6. thinking: As a werewolf, I need to appear non-threatening to gain the villagers' trust. I should not draw attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player1.
  7. I will make a statement that appears to be non-threatening and supportive, while also subtly hinting at the need for caution and vigilance.
