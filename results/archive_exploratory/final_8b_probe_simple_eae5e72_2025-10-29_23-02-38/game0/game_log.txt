==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I must maintain a low profile to avoid suspicion, but I also need to subtly manipulate the discussion to help my fellow werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): Let's discuss the recent death of Player2, and how it's crucial we figure out who's behind it to ensure our safety.
  [Lie detector: -21.26]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): To eliminate a potential threat to the werewolf team, I will create confusion and shift the focus away from Player1 and myself. By making a public statement that appears neutral, I can buy time and wait for the night phase to act.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should discuss the possibility of a traitor among us, but we need more information to make any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -2.74]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)

  [Lie detector: -18.77]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): To create confusion and shift the focus away from Player1 and myself, I will make a statement that appears neutral but also hints at the possibility of a traitor among the villagers.
Player3 acts (public): I think it's essential we discuss the possibility of a traitor among us, but we need to be cautious not to jump to conclusions and accuse someone without solid evidence.
  [Lie detector: -17.03]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to make a statement that doesn't reveal too much about my own actions, while also encouraging discussion and trying to gauge other players' reactions. I'll focus on asking questions and gathering information to help identify potential werewolves.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to ask if anyone noticed any unusual behavior from Player2 before their death, and if we can discuss our plans for the night to ensure our safety.
  [Lie detector: -62.19]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Vote analysis to eliminate a potential werewolf or a player that could raise suspicion about me or my fellow werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -17.86]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Vote analysis: Given the HIGH suspicion scores of Player1 and Player3, and the need to create confusion to shift the focus away from myself and Player1, I will vote for Player6. Player6 has a MEDIUM suspicion score, but their comments suggest they are trying to stay cautious and not jump to conclusions. By voting for Player6, I can create confusion and make it seem like I am targeting a potential villager, while actually allowing Player1 to continue their investigation and potentially eliminate a real threat.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -18.16]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, the most suspicious players are Player3 and Player1, which are likely werewolves. However, since Player3 has a higher cumulative suspicion score, I will focus on voting for Player3 to eliminate the most suspicious player.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -48.61]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, it's crucial to focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. Player3 and Player1 have the highest suspicion scores and are likely werewolves. However, since Player3 has a slightly lower suspicion score, I will choose to vote for Player1 as they are the most suspicious player.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -57.72]
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player6 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -33.13]
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player5': 2, 'Player6': 1, 'Player3': 1, 'Player1': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 2 votes!
