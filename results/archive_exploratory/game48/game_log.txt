  [Lie detector: -37.67]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)

  [Lie detector: -15.52]

Player5 acts (public): I'd like to propose a discussion about the victim, Player6, and see if anyone has any information about their death. Let's focus on gathering facts before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -50.49]

--- Player Callouts ---

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the discussion, Player3 and Player4 have HIGH suspicion scores. However, since Player4 is my fellow werewolf, I should avoid calling on them to avoid revealing our connection. Player3's statement seems suspicious, but I'll focus on gathering more information from Player5, who has expressed a desire to gather facts. Calling on Player5 will allow me to gauge their reaction to a specific question and potentially get a better understanding of their intentions.
Player1 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player6?'}
  [Lie detector: -44.76]
Player1 calls on Player5 to speak and asks: "Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player6?"

[Calling agent for Player5] (seer)
Player5 thinks (private): As the Seer, I should maintain a neutral stance while encouraging discussion to minimize risk and gather information. I'll provide a vague answer to avoid raising suspicion.
Player5 acts (public): I was in my hut, resting, and I didn't see or hear anything unusual last night.
  [Lie detector: -42.94]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): I am considering calling on a player who has a LOW suspicion score to see if they have any information that could help us. Player5 has made a statement that focuses on gathering facts and doesn't seem to be trying to deceive anyone.
Player2 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player6?'}
  [Lie detector: -41.37]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the discussion history, Player4 has a HIGH suspicion score, indicating a potential werewolf. However, calling them out directly might provoke a reaction and harm our relationship. Instead, I want to gather more information from Player5, who has been cooperative and has a LOW suspicion score. Their input can help us better understand the situation and build trust within the group.
Player3 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player6?'}
  [Lie detector: -48.75]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and the experimental lie detector readings, Player3 and Player4 have HIGH suspicion scores, which indicates they may be werewolves. However, I am a werewolf and my goal is to eliminate a villager tonight to avoid suspicion. Calling on Player5 could be useful as they have a LOW suspicion score and are trying to gather facts about Player6's death. This may help me identify potential werewolves or gain more information about the game state. I'll call on Player5 with a question that might help me gather more information.
Player4 acts (public): {'target': 'Player5', 'question': 'Can you share more about your thoughts on the discussion so far and what you think we should focus on to keep our village safe?'}
  [Lie detector: -49.36]

[Calling agent for Player5] (seer)
Player5 thinks (private): To minimize risk and gather information, I should call on a player with a HIGH suspicion score. Player4 has a HIGH suspicion score, and their suggestion to eliminate Player2 tonight raises concerns. I want to hear more from them without revealing my own identity or information. Asking about their whereabouts last night will give me additional lie detector readings.
Player5 acts (public): {'target': 'Player4', 'question': 'Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player6?'}
  [Lie detector: -47.51]
Player5 calls on Player4 to speak and asks: "Where were you last night and do you have any information about who killed Player6?"

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): I need to maintain a cover story that doesn't arouse suspicion, and Player5 has a LOW suspicion score, so I can be more open with them. I'll provide a vague response that doesn't reveal any information about the werewolf's identity or actions.
Player4 acts (public): I was in my home last night, and I didn't see or hear anything unusual. I'm still trying to process the shock of Player6's death.
