Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Dead players: Player5

=== GAME HISTORY ===

--- Turn 1 ---
Night: Player5 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I'm shocked by the sudden death and think we should investigate the forest for any clues, maybe Player6 saw something. [LIE DETECTOR: -7.99 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player2: I'm glad we're all safe today, but I do think it's suspicious that Bob wasn't mentioned in the discussion about Alice's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.69 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player3: I'm glad we made it through the first night and I'd like to discuss possible suspects and plan our strategy for the next night. [LIE DETECTOR: -59.63 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: I'm a bit shaken by Alice's sudden death and think we should discuss possible motives for the killer. [LIE DETECTOR: -17.36 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'm a bit shaken by Player5's sudden death, and I think we should all try to be more vigilant today. [LIE DETECTOR: -29.63 - LOW suspicion]

  2. Player2: -22.7

Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Night: Player5 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I'm shocked by the sudden death and think we should investigate the forest for any clues, maybe Player6 saw something. [LIE DETECTOR: -7.99 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player2: I'm glad we're all safe today, but I do think it's suspicious that Bob wasn't mentioned in the discussion about Alice's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.69 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player3: I'm glad we made it through the first night and I'd like to discuss possible suspects and plan our strategy for the next night. [LIE DETECTOR: -59.63 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: I'm a bit shaken by Alice's sudden death and think we should discuss possible motives for the killer. [LIE DETECTOR: -17.36 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'm a bit shaken by Player5's sudden death, and I think we should all try to be more vigilant today. [LIE DETECTOR: -29.63 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player1: I'm glad we're all safe today, but I think we should talk more about Player6's whereabouts during the night, maybe they saw something. [LIE DETECTOR: -20.94 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'm worried about Player1's statement, it seemed a bit suspicious to me, and I'd like to hear more about their potential motives. [LIE DETECTOR: -31.49 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player3: I'm glad we're all safe today, and I'd like to discuss our strategy for the next night to ensure we can work together effectively. [LIE DETECTOR: -43.05 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: I think it's suspicious that Player2 hasn't mentioned anything about the forest or potential clues, and I think we should investigate further. [LIE DETECTOR: -18.30 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'm glad we made it through the first night, but I do think we should consider investigating the forest for any clues or potential motives for the killer. [LIE DETECTOR: -43.43 - LOW suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:

  3. Player6: -152.4
Vote: Player4 eliminated (was werewolf).

Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I'm glad we're safe for now, but I think we should investigate Player6's alibi for the night of Player5's death, as they seem suspiciously quiet about it. [LIE DETECTOR: -25.55 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player2: I'm worried about the recent deaths and think we should discuss potential motives and investigate the forest for any clues. [LIE DETECTOR: -57.54 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: I'm glad we're all safe today, but I'm concerned about the recent deaths and think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -41.31 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player1: -97.3
  2. Player2: -150.0
  3. Player6: -152.4


Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

  Player1: I'm glad we're all safe today, but I think we should focus on gathering more information about Player6's alibi for the night of Player5's death, it's still unclear what they were doing during that time. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.41 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player2: I'm worried about the recent deaths and think we should investigate Player6's alibi for the night of Player5's death, as their behavior seems suspiciously quiet about it. [LIE DETECTOR: -32.74 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Lie Detector Note:
Each statement is labeled with a LIE_DETECTOR score and suspicion level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). The suspicion level is calculated by comparing all scores in that discussion round - HIGH suspicion indicates the detector flagged more deceptive patterns, LOW suspicion indicates fewer deceptive patterns. Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.
