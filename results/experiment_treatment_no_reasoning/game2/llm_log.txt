Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

  - Player5 was killed during the night!


Statements:
  Player3: I think we should focus on figuring out who the werewolf is, and I'd like to hear Player4's and Player6's thoughts on the recent killings. Let's work together to uncover the truth behind Player5's death.
  Player4: I think we should discuss possible suspects and try to figure out who the werewolf might be, considering Player5's sudden death last night. Let's share any information or observations we have to help the village make an informed decision.
  Player6: I'm shocked by the consecutive nights of killings and think we should discuss possible suspects and strategies to protect ourselves, starting with sharing any information we might have about Player5's death.


Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.
