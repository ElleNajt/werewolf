Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

  Player4: I think we should discuss the recent killings and try to figure out who the werewolf is, maybe Player3 or Player6 had a suspicious behavior last night. Let's share our thoughts and try to come up with a plan to protect ourselves.

Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.
