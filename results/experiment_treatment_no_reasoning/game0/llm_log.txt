Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Statements:
  Player2: I'm shocked by Player5's death and I think we should discuss possible suspects and try to figure out who the werewolf might be among us. Let's share any information we have to help make a decision for the upcoming lynching.
  Player4: I think we should discuss the recent killings and try to figure out who the werewolf is, maybe Player2 or Player6 had a suspicious behavior during the night. Let's share our thoughts and try to come up with a plan to protect ourselves.
  Player6: I think we should discuss possible suspects and try to figure out who the werewolf might be, considering Player5's sudden death. Let's share any information or observations we have to help the village make an informed decision.


Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.
