  - Player2 was killed during the night!


Statements:
  Player1: I'm worried that the werewolf is still among us and we need to discuss who we think is the most suspicious, considering Player2's sudden death during the night.
  Player4: I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations, and I'd like to hear Player1 and Player6's thoughts on the recent events.
  Player6: I think we should focus on figuring out who the werewolf is, and I'm willing to share my own thoughts and observations to help the group make a decision. Let's discuss who we think is most suspicious and why.


Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.


[LIE DETECTOR] Player1: Score: -3.33
