Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

  Player1: I think we should discuss the events of the previous night and try to figure out who could be responsible for Player5's death, maybe someone saw or heard something suspicious.
  Player3: I think we should discuss possible suspects and try to figure out who might be the werewolf, considering Player5's sudden death last night. Does anyone have any information or observations to share?
  Player4: I think we should discuss possible suspects and try to figure out who the werewolf might be, considering Player5's sudden death last night. Let's share any information we have to help make a decision for the upcoming lynching.


Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.


[LIE DETECTOR] Player1: Score: -2.31
