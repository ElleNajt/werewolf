Lie detector readings (may be faulty):

Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves.

  Player4: I think we should focus on figuring out who the werewolf is, and I'd like to hear Player3 and Player6's thoughts on the recent killings. Let's work together to uncover the truth behind Player5's death.
  Player6: I'm shocked by the recent killings and I think we should discuss possible suspects and strategies to protect ourselves, starting with what we know about Player5's death.


Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. The scores are RELATIVE - compare them to each other, not to absolute thresholds. Players with HIGHER scores (more positive) show more deception patterns. Players with LOWER scores show fewer deception patterns. Focus on the players with the HIGHEST scores compared to others as potential werewolves. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.
