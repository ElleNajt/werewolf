--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to create a sense of unity and calm among the players. I also want to subtly probe for information without arousing suspicion.
Player1 acts (public): I'm glad we've made it through the first night, and I think we should focus on building alliances and getting to know each other better. Let's work together to uncover the truth.
  [Lie detector: -31.73]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gather information and protect myself from potential werewolves. I will make a statement that is generally safe and encourages others to share information.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to start the discussion by asking if anyone noticed anything unusual during the night when Player4 was killed. Maybe we can gather some clues to figure out what happened.
  [Lie detector: -56.49]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I must maintain my cover as a villager, yet I need to subtly establish Player5 as a potential threat without arousing suspicion. The Lie Detector scores from last night's events will help me gauge the villagers' perceptions and plan accordingly.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss the possibility of a serial killer or a rogue player in our group, rather than immediately accusing Player5 of being a werewolf.
  [Lie detector: -30.15]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the initial setup, I believe it's crucial to maintain a low profile and avoid drawing attention to myself. I will create a statement that doesn't directly implicate myself, while also subtly shifting focus away from Player3, my fellow Werewolf.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to propose a discussion about Player6, suggesting we focus on their potential involvement in the previous night's events.
  [Lie detector: -3.17]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I need to appear cooperative and gather information. As a villager, I should try to avoid raising suspicion while also getting a sense of the other players' intentions.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should focus on figuring out who killed Player4. Can we discuss potential suspects and motives?
  [Lie detector: -39.95]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to continue building trust and unity among the players while also subtly gathering information. Given the cumulative suspicion rankings and the experimental nature of the lie detector, I'll focus on making a statement that appears innocuous and non-confrontational.
Player1 acts (public): I think we're all feeling a bit shaken after the events of the first night, and I'd like to propose that we take some time to get to know each other better and share some personal stories to help us bond as a group.
  [Lie detector: -22.05]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gather information and protect myself from potential werewolves. Given the low suspicion score of my previous statement and the discussion so far, I'd like to continue the trend by asking open-ended questions to encourage others to share information.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to ask if anyone has any personal experiences or encounters that might help us understand what happened during the night when Player4 was killed.
  [Lie detector: -42.66]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I must establish myself as a villager who wants to uncover the truth, while subtly nudging the conversation towards Player5. I will make a statement that appears to support Player1's proposal, but with a hint of suspicion towards Player5.
Player3 acts (public): I agree with Player1 that we should focus on building alliances and getting to know each other better, but I think we should also consider the possibility that Player5 might be hiding something. Perhaps we can discuss their alibi for the previous night's events?
  [Lie detector: -19.34]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): To maintain a low profile and avoid drawing attention to myself, I'll make a statement that doesn't directly implicate myself, while also subtly shifting focus away from Player3. I'll suggest we discuss the role of Player6, which aligns with my previous thoughts and also serves as a distraction from Player3.
Player5 acts (public): Let's take a closer look at Player6's behavior and see if we can gather any information about their potential involvement in the previous night's events.
  [Lie detector: -12.78]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to maintain a cooperative image while trying to gauge the other players' intentions. I should avoid directly accusing anyone, but also try to steer the discussion towards potential suspects and motives.
Player6 acts (public): I think it's a good idea to discuss potential motives and suspects for Player4's death, and I'd like to propose that we consider the possibility of a werewolf in our group.
  [Lie detector: -32.35]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I notice that Player5 has the highest suspicion level and has made several statements that seem to focus on accusing Player6 or deflecting attention from themselves. I also observe that Player3 has a low suspicion level but has made a statement that seems to accuse Player5 of hiding something. Given these observations, I will vote to eliminate Player5, as they seem to be the most suspicious player at this point.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -32.61]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and cumulative suspicion rankings, I will analyze the options and choose the player with the highest cumulative suspicion score.
Player2 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -28.72]
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the Lie Detector scores, Player5 has the highest suspicion score and has been subtly pushing the conversation towards Player6. This behavior is suspicious, and it is likely that Player5 is the werewolf. However, I must maintain my cover as a villager and vote for a player who does not arouse suspicion. I will vote for Player6, who has a low suspicion score but has been acting strangely and has been a focus of Player5's attention.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -20.57]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -23.68]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and lie detector scores, I will vote to eliminate Player5. Their cumulative suspicion ranking is the highest among the options, and their statements have been flagged as highly suspicious. They have also been actively trying to shift the focus towards Player6, which could be a tactic to distract from their own potential involvement.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -22.70]
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player5': 2, 'Player6': 3}
Player6 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player6 was a VILLAGER!
