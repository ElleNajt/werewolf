TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I will vote to eliminate Player3. Player3's statements, especially the one with a LIE_DETECTOR score of -10.91, indicate a high level of suspicion. Additionally, Player3's suggestion to focus on building trust among each other without solid evidence may be a tactic to deflect attention.
