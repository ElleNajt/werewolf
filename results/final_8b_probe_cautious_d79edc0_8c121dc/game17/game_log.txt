  [Lie detector: -12.53]

  [Lie detector: -1.01]

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): I need to assess the situation and gather more information from other players. Considering the death of Player4 and the previous discussions, I'll try to identify potential werewolves and encourage others to do the same. Player2's LOW suspicion and Player6's MEDIUM suspicion are notable, but I should also consider Player2's HIGH suspicion in previous discussions and Player6's somewhat inconsistent statements. Given the experimental nature of the lie detector, I'll also keep an eye on Player2's behavior.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we re-examine the events of the past two nights and try to identify any patterns or potential leads that might help us figure out who among us is a werewolf.
  [Lie detector: -50.08]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As Player2, I need to make a neutral statement to avoid raising suspicion. Given the experimental nature of the lie detector and the low suspicion levels of some players, I'll make a statement that doesn't reveal too much about my own thoughts or intentions.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should focus on building a strong sense of community and trust among us, and encourage anyone with information about last night's events to share it freely.
  [Lie detector: -18.63]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): I will maintain a neutral stance while hinting that I'm not a werewolf by making a statement that doesn't directly accuse anyone, but also doesn't seem overly concerned about Player5's death. Given the current suspicion rankings and the experimental lie detector scores, I will focus on eliminating a player who seems suspicious, but not directly accusing the most likely werewolf target.
Player6 acts (public): I think it's possible that we're all just trying to survive in this village, and sometimes that means making tough decisions. Let's try to keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions about each other.

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the previous discussions and the experimental lie detector, I believe that Player2's behavior is still suspicious, especially given their HIGH suspicion in the previous discussions. I also want to encourage the other players to re-examine the events of the past two nights and try to identify any patterns or potential leads.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we re-examine the events of the past two nights and try to identify any patterns or potential leads that might help us figure out who among us is a werewolf.
  [Lie detector: -23.11]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information without arousing suspicion. I will make a neutral statement to avoid raising suspicion and learn more about the other players' thoughts.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should all try to stay calm and think clearly about what's going on in the village, so we can make informed decisions.
  [Lie detector: 8.75]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the current suspicion rankings and the experimental lie detector scores, I will maintain a neutral stance while hinting that I'm not a werewolf by making a statement that doesn't directly accuse anyone, but also doesn't seem overly concerned about Player5's death.

==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and previous discussions, I will vote to eliminate Player2.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -23.51]
Player1 votes for: Player2

  Backend error on attempt 1: Failed to get valid JSON after 1 attempts: Invalid control character at: line 2 column 137 (char 138)
  Retry 1/5 for Player2...
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the discussion history and the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will vote to eliminate Player6. While Player6 has made some neutral statements, they also seem to be downplaying the importance of investigating the events of the previous nights. Additionally, their lie detector scores indicate a higher level of suspicion, which could suggest that they are trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves. On the other hand, Player1 has made some statements that seem to be trying to steer the discussion in a specific direction, but their cumulative suspicion ranking is still relatively low. Considering the experimental nature of the lie detector, I will err on the side of caution and vote to eliminate Player6.
