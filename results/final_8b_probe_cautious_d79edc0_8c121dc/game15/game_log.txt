--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I need to maintain a neutral tone to avoid raising suspicion. I will also try to gauge the reactions of my fellow villagers and werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to start the discussion by saying that I'm still trying to process the events of last night and I'm not sure what to make of Player2's death.
  [Lie detector: -40.66]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): I need to establish a rapport with the other villagers to build trust, while also gathering information about potential werewolves. I'll make a statement that's friendly and non-accusatory.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we focus on building alliances and working together to uncover the truth, rather than jumping to conclusions about who might be a werewolf.
  [Lie detector: -24.78]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to maximize team knowledge while appearing neutral. I will make a statement that is vague and encourages discussion without revealing my true intentions. Considering the experimental nature of the Lie Detector, I will use its scores to my advantage by making a statement that is slightly misleading, increasing the chances of deflecting suspicion.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should focus on finding out who might have been involved in Player2's death. Perhaps we can discuss the motives behind their actions.
  [Lie detector: -17.21]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information and reduce the suspicion on myself. Since Player2 was killed on the first night, I'm likely to be one of the werewolves.
Player5 acts (public): I propose we discuss the events of the first night and see if anyone remembers anything unusual.
  [Lie detector: -41.02]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, my primary goal is to gain information and build trust with other players. Considering the experimental nature of the Lie Detector, I'll focus on making a statement that seems innocent and non-confrontational.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to start the discussion by expressing my condolences for Player2's death and suggesting we focus on getting to know each other better today.
  [Lie detector: -40.65]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): To maintain a neutral tone, I'll focus on the discussion at hand and express my condolences for Player2's death. I also want to observe the reactions of my fellow villagers, particularly Player3 and Player4, to gauge their level of suspicion and potential alignment.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to start by expressing my condolences for Player2's death and suggesting we focus on understanding what happened last night.
  [Lie detector: -48.38]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the previous discussion, I've noticed that Player3 has a HIGH suspicion level due to their statement about building alliances and working together. I'll make a statement that's friendly and non-accusatory to establish a rapport with the other villagers and also subtly counter Player3's suggestion.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we work together to uncover the truth, but let's also make sure we're not jumping to conclusions or making any rash decisions without considering all the facts.
  [Lie detector: -5.54]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): I will make a statement that is vague and encourages discussion without revealing my true intentions. Given the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will target Player3 and Player6 to deflect suspicion from myself and Player1. I will also try to gather more information about the events of the first night.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to discuss the potential motives behind Player2's death and how they might be connected to our individual actions last night.
  [Lie detector: -47.25]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, it seems like Player3 has the highest suspicion level. I should avoid drawing attention to myself and instead focus on reassuring the other players that I'm trustworthy. I'll make a statement that is both helpful and non-confrontational.
Player5 acts (public): I think we should focus on building a strong community by sharing our experiences and getting to know each other better today. Perhaps we can discuss our favorite hobbies or interests.
  [Lie detector: -7.07]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gain information and build trust. I should make a statement that seems innocent and non-confrontational, while also trying to get to know the other players better. Given the Lie Detector scores, I should be cautious of Player3's high suspicion and try to avoid direct confrontation. I'll make a statement that focuses on the group's well-being and encourages cooperation.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we all work together to ensure our safety and well-being, and I'm open to hearing any ideas or concerns that anyone may have today.
  [Lie detector: -31.36]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will analyze the potential targets for elimination.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -32.31]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I will vote to eliminate Player4. Their statement about discussing motives behind Player2's death has a HIGH suspicion level, and their cumulative score is significantly lower than the others. This suggests that Player4 may be hiding something.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -34.50]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): I will vote for Player3 to deflect suspicion from myself and Player1. Voting for Player3 also allows me to target a player with lower cumulative suspicion, making it seem like I'm trying to eliminate a potential werewolf. This strategy also aligns with my goal of maximizing team knowledge while appearing neutral.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -31.11]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, I will vote for Player3. Their HIGH suspicion level and statements that could be perceived as defensive or evasive make them a likely candidate for the werewolf. By voting for Player3, I can reduce the suspicion on myself and potentially eliminate a werewolf.
Player5 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -34.01]
Player5 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player6 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -35.75]
Player6 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player4': 3, 'Player3': 2}
Player4 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player4 was a WEREWOLF!

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As the last werewolf, I need to eliminate a player who is least likely to be a werewolf or has a low suspicion ranking to avoid raising suspicion. Player3 and Player6 seem to be neutral, but I need to consider the reactions and discussions from the previous phase. Since Player5 has not been a part of the discussion yet, it's difficult to gauge their suspicion level. I will eliminate Player3, as they seemed to be the most engaged in the discussion, and their reactions might raise suspicion if they're a werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -20.12]

Werewolf votes: {'Player1': 'Player3'}

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I will vote to eliminate Player6, as they have been consistently expressing a desire to work together and build a sense of community, which may be a tactic to gain trust. Their cumulative suspicion ranking is also relatively low, making them a less likely target for elimination.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -6.58]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): After reviewing the discussion history and cumulative suspicion rankings, I have decided to vote for Player6. Although they have a low suspicion level, their recent statements seem to be a bit too rehearsed and focused on building alliances, which could be a sign of a werewolf trying to manipulate the group. Additionally, I want to reduce the suspicion on myself by not voting for Player1, who has been making statements that could be perceived as defensive or evasive.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -17.68]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the Lie Detector scores, I've analyzed the statements of the remaining players and found no direct clues pointing to a werewolf. However, I've noticed that Player1's statements have a HIGH suspicion level, which might indicate that they are trying to manipulate the group. On the other hand, Player5's low suspicion level and positive statements towards me suggest that they might be a trustworthy ally. Considering the options, I will vote to eliminate Player1, as their behavior seems more suspicious.
