--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As Player2, a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral stance to avoid drawing attention. I'll make a statement that could be seen as helpful or misleading.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should try to figure out who might have been involved in Player1's death. We should ask questions to gather more information.
  [Lie detector: -11.79]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to remain hidden and gather information from other players. Given the lack of information and the experimental nature of the lie detector, I will make a statement that is neutral and non-committal, while also trying to subtly gather information from Player2.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should discuss the events of last night, but I'm not sure what to make of it.
  [Lie detector: -22.28]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Since Player1 was killed on Night 1, it's likely a werewolf. I should express concern about the possibility of werewolves without directly accusing anyone.
Player4 acts (public): I'm concerned about the sudden death of Player1 and I think we should discuss the possibility of werewolves in our village.
  [Lie detector: -40.73]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information and create a sense of safety among the group. I should avoid directly accusing anyone and instead focus on building trust.
Player5 acts (public): I think it's great that we're all still alive after the first night, and I'd like to propose that we focus on gathering information and working together to ensure our safety going forward.
  [Lie detector: -33.50]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to appear trustworthy and non-threatening. Given that Player1 is dead, I should focus on building alliances and gathering information without arousing suspicion.
Player6 acts (public): I'm glad we're all safe for now, and I think we should focus on getting to know each other better during the day to avoid any misunderstandings at night.
  [Lie detector: -13.09]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I will make a statement that appears neutral and non-confrontational, while also subtly casting doubt on Player6's suggestion to focus on getting to know each other. This will help maintain a neutral stance and avoid drawing attention to myself.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should definitely focus on gathering information and working together to ensure our safety going forward, but we also need to be cautious not to overlook any potential dangers that may be lurking in the shadows.
  [Lie detector: -9.22]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to remain hidden and gather information from other players. Given the lack of information and the experimental nature of the lie detector, I will make a statement that is neutral and non-committal, while also trying to subtly gather information from Player2. I will try to assess Player2's reaction to my statement and see if they provide any insight into their role in the game. I will also try to gauge the reaction of the other players and see if they seem suspicious or not.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should all try to get to know each other better during the day, and perhaps we can discuss our roles and responsibilities in the village.
  [Lie detector: -3.64]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the experimental lie detector results, I notice Player2 and Player6 have high suspicion levels. Player2's statement implies guilt, while Player6 suggests a focus on getting to know each other, which may be a diversion. I will express concern about the possibility of werewolves without directly accusing anyone.
Player4 acts (public): I'm concerned about the sudden death of Player1 and I think we should discuss the possibility of werewolves in our village, while also considering the importance of getting to know each other to avoid misunderstandings at night.
  [Lie detector: -50.00]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)

  [Lie detector: -35.82]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to appear trustworthy and non-threatening while also trying to gather information without arousing suspicion. I should focus on building alliances and getting to know other players without making any accusations or raising unnecessary alarms.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -8.46]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Given the current situation, I must decide who to vote for to eliminate. Considering the lie detector scores and the discussion, I notice that Player2 has a HIGH suspicion level (-9.22) and seems to be cautious, which could be a sign of a werewolf trying to remain hidden. However, I also have to consider the fact that Player2 is my fellow werewolf and we need to work together to achieve our goals. I will vote for Player5, who has the LOWEST suspicion level (-69.3) and seems to be the least suspicious player. This will allow me to gain more information about the other players and potentially create an opportunity for Player2 and me to eliminate a more suspicious player later on.
Player3 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -20.96]
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector results and the discussion, I will consider the cumulative suspicion rankings and the statements made by each player. Player5 has the lowest cumulative suspicion ranking, indicating the least suspicious behavior. However, Player5 also proposed focusing on gathering information and working together, which could be a clever distraction. Considering the experimental nature of the lie detector, I will also examine the specific statements made by each player. Player2's statement implies guilt, while Player6 suggests a focus on getting to know each other, which may be a diversion. Given these factors, I will vote to eliminate Player2.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -37.65]
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player5 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -38.23]
Player5 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, it appears that Player5 has the highest cumulative suspicion score, indicating a higher likelihood of being a werewolf. Additionally, Player2 and Player3 have high suspicion scores and have made statements that could be interpreted as deceptive. Given the need to eliminate one player, I will vote to eliminate Player5.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -27.13]
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player5': 4, 'Player2': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 4 votes!
Player5 was a VILLAGER!
