--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gather information and figure out who the werewolves are. Since Player3 is dead, I need to focus on the remaining players.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to ask, has anyone seen or heard anything suspicious about anyone's behavior last night?
  [Lie detector: -30.65]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to create confusion and distract from my true intentions. I will make a statement that appears neutral and does not directly point to any player, while also subtly hinting at the existence of a werewolf without arousing immediate suspicion.
Player2 acts (public): I think it's a good idea for us to be cautious and not jump to conclusions, but we should also be aware that someone might be hiding something.
  [Lie detector: 2.85]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As Player4, I'm a villager, and I need to make a statement that doesn't raise suspicion but also doesn't reveal too much information. I'll focus on expressing concern for the recent death and asking for information.
Player4 acts (public): I'm concerned about the recent death of Player3. Can we discuss what happened during the night and gather more information about the circumstances of their death?
  [Lie detector: -67.06]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As Player5, a villager, my goal is to appear cooperative and gather information without arousing suspicion. I'll make a statement that doesn't reveal too much, but shows my concern for the recent death.
Player5 acts (public): I think it's crucial we discuss the events of last night and try to figure out who might be behind Player3's death. Let's focus on gathering information and finding a lead.
  [Lie detector: -47.11]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I must be cautious and blend in with the villagers. I will create a distraction by questioning Player1's vote for Player3 to gain more information.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to ask Player1, what made you decide to vote for Player3 during the initial night phase?
  [Lie detector: -6.75]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): I need to gather more information about the events of last night and try to figure out who might be behind Player3's death. Based on the lie detector scores, Player2 seems suspicious, but I also want to ask Player6 more questions.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to ask Player6, can you elaborate on what made you think to ask me about my vote during the initial night phase?
  [Lie detector: -23.07]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance while subtly hinting at the existence of a werewolf without arousing immediate suspicion. I will make a statement that encourages the group to discuss possible motives and actions without directly pointing to any player.
Player2 acts (public): Let's not jump to conclusions about the recent events, but it's essential that we consider the possibility of a hidden agenda or a deliberate action behind Player3's death.
  [Lie detector: -34.66]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to maintain a neutral stance and avoid raising suspicion. I'll express concern for the recent death and ask for information without revealing too much.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to understand the events of last night better and hear any information anyone may have about the circumstances surrounding Player3's death.
  [Lie detector: -65.17]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to appear cooperative and gather information without arousing suspicion. My previous statement focused on gathering information, but I didn't reveal too much. Considering the current suspicion rankings, I should be cautious not to align myself too closely with the high-suspicion players, but also not be too confrontational. I'll make a statement that acknowledges the concern for the recent death and shows my commitment to finding the truth.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we establish a system to gather and share information about any suspicious behavior or events that occur during the night, so we can make more informed decisions in the future.
  [Lie detector: -51.20]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to appear concerned and involved in the investigation to maintain my cover. I'll express a desire for more information about Player3's death, while subtly trying to deflect attention from myself.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to ask, can we get a more detailed account of the events surrounding Player3's death, perhaps someone saw or heard something that could help us figure out what happened?
  [Lie detector: -34.83]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -34.64]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the current discussion and lie detector scores, it appears that Player6 is the most suspicious player among the werewolves. I will make a statement that encourages the group to discuss possible motives and actions without directly pointing to any player, while also subtly hinting at the existence of a werewolf.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -12.00]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player4 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -41.80]
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and cumulative suspicion rankings, I will avoid voting for Player4 as they have the lowest suspicion score and have been cooperative in the discussion. I will also avoid voting for Player5, as it could be seen as self-serving. Between Player1, Player2, and Player6, Player2 has the second-lowest suspicion score and has been expressing caution, which could be seen as a positive trait. However, Player2's high suspicion score in the discussion suggests they might be hiding something. Between Player1 and Player6, Player6 has the highest suspicion score but has been asking questions, which could be seen as an attempt to gather information. Considering my goal as a villager is to appear cooperative and gather information, I will vote for Player1, as they have a lower suspicion score than Player6 and have been expressing a desire to avoid jumping to conclusions.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -23.43]
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): To maintain my cover and avoid raising suspicion, I need to eliminate a player who is not a werewolf and doesn't pose an immediate threat to my identity. Given the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player5 has the lowest suspicion score, indicating that they may not be a werewolf or are not yet suspicious enough to be targeted.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -36.84]
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player6': 1, 'Player4': 1, 'Player5': 2, 'Player1': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player5 was a VILLAGER!
