[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): To maintain a neutral image and avoid raising suspicion, I will vote to eliminate Player4, a fellow werewolf. This decision is based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, which show Player4's relatively low suspicion level compared to Player3's high suspicion level.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -13.51]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to eliminate a player who poses the least threat to me. I've observed the discussion and the lie detector scores. Player6 has the lowest cumulative suspicion ranking and their statements seem genuine, making them less likely to be the werewolf. Player3 has a high suspicion ranking, which makes them a potential target, but I want to avoid drawing attention to myself. Player1 and Player5 have low suspicion rankings and seem cooperative, but I need to eliminate one of them to reduce the number of potential villagers. Based on the information, I will vote to eliminate Player1, as they have a slightly higher suspicion score than Player5 and are being targeted by Player6.
