  [Lie detector: -26.09]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Maintain anonymity and observe for now. Player3 and Player5 have low suspicion levels, but Player4 is also a potential werewolf and a lower risk target than Player3. Vote for Player3 to eliminate a lower suspicion target and keep Player4 in the game.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -24.16]
Player2 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I, Player3, will vote to eliminate Player2. The high suspicion score indicates that Player2's statements may be deceptive, and their repeated emphasis on the group's unity and cooperation raises red flags. As a villager, my goal is to eliminate potential threats, and Player2's behavior warrants further investigation.
Player3 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -29.17]
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -9.80]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I will vote to eliminate Player2. Their high suspicion level and multiple statements with high lie detector scores suggest they may be a werewolf. Additionally, their statements seem overly defensive and focused on building trust, which could be a tactic to gain the group's trust.

  [Lie detector: -24.03]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
