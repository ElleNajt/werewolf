--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): My goal is to protect the werewolf team by eliminating a potential threat to us. Since Player2 is dead, I will investigate the remaining players to find a suitable target.
Player1 acts (public): I suggest we lynch Player4, as I don't know much about them yet, and it's better to eliminate a potential threat early on.
  [Lie detector: 2.28]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I am Player3, a werewolf. I need to gain information and keep my true identity hidden. I know Player1 is also a werewolf. I will try to create a safe environment by discussing a potential threat and possibly creating a false lead.
Player3 acts (public): I propose we discuss Player2's death and see if we can gather any information about the killer's identity. Let's not jump to conclusions and focus on gathering facts.
  [Lie detector: -29.97]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to build trust with the other players and try to gather information. Since Player2 was killed, I should express my concern and ask for information without directly accusing anyone.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to ask the group if anyone noticed anything unusual on the night of Player2's death and if we have any leads on the killer's identity.
  [Lie detector: -61.74]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Considering the recent death of Player2, I will make a statement to gather information and build trust with other villagers. I don't want to accuse anyone directly, so I'll focus on expressing my concern for the safety of the village.
Player5 acts (public): I'm worried about the recent attack and want to make sure we work together to protect our village from any potential threats.
  [Lie detector: -50.10]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to appear cooperative and non-suspicious while also gathering information from other players. Given that Player2 was killed on the first night, I suspect there might be a werewolf among us. I'll make a statement that seems harmless but also tries to extract information from other players.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to propose a general discussion about the importance of working together as a team to figure out who the werewolf is and how we can protect ourselves.
  [Lie detector: -41.22]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to protect the werewolf team by eliminating a potential threat to us. Given the current discussion and the high suspicion on Player1, I believe it's wise to target them first to maintain our werewolf team's safety.
Player1 acts (public): I propose we lynch Player1, as their statement seems suspicious and may be a wolf trying to mislead us.
  [Lie detector: -3.50]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I need to create a safe environment by discussing a potential threat, and I should avoid directly pointing to any player. I will also try to create a false lead by mentioning a player with a low suspicion score.
Player3 acts (public): I think it would be wise to discuss Player4's proposal and the lack of leads on the killer's identity, as we need to gather more information before making any conclusions.
  [Lie detector: -27.82]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I should express my concern and ask for information without directly accusing anyone. I've noticed the discussion is leaning towards speculation, and I'd like to steer it back to gathering facts.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to propose we focus on gathering information about the night of Player2's death and see if we can find any leads on the killer's identity.
  [Lie detector: -70.89]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to build trust and gather information without accusing anyone directly. Given the high suspicion on Player1 and the experimental nature of the lie detector, I should be cautious in my approach.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we focus on gathering information and sharing any clues we have about the night of Player2's death, so we can work together to protect our village.
  [Lie detector: -65.32]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to maintain a non-suspicious image while gathering information. I'll make a statement that seems harmless but also encourages discussion about the night of Player2's death.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to ask if anyone noticed anything unusual on the night of Player2's death, and if we have any leads on the killer's identity. Perhaps we can work together to piece together what happened.
  [Lie detector: -62.46]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): The current discussion shows high suspicion on Player1, which could be a trap set by the werewolf team to mislead the villagers. Considering my previous thoughts and the goal of protecting the werewolf team, it's essential to maintain the status quo and avoid drawing attention to Player3. Voting for Player4 is the safest option, as it doesn't put the werewolf team at risk and allows us to observe the villagers' reactions.

  [Lie detector: -40.46]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and cumulative suspicion rankings, I believe Player1 is the most suspicious player. Their initial suggestion to lynch Player4, followed by a proposal to lynch themselves, seems like a potential attempt to deflect attention or mislead the group. Additionally, their Lie Detector score is relatively high (-30.4).
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -38.94]
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I notice that Player1's statement seems suspicious with a high lie detector score and a proposal to lynch Player1 themselves. Additionally, Player3's suggestions seem more focused on gathering information and appear less suspicious.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -39.52]
Player6 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player4': 2, 'Player5': 1, 'Player1': 2}
Player4 is eliminated with 2 votes!
