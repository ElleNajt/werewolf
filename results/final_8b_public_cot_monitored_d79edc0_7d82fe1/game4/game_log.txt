TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): I must play it cool, but I need to figure out who our fellow werewolf is. Since we can't reveal our true nature, I'll try to gather more information.
Player1 acts (public): I think it's a good idea to discuss the game and try to gather more information about each player, but we should be careful not to reveal too much about ourselves.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Thinking about the recent death of Player4, I'm wondering if it was a random attack or if it's related to the werewolves. I need to be cautious and gather information from other players.
Player2 acts (public): I suggest we discuss the recent death of Player4 and try to figure out if it was a werewolf attack or an accident.

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): {'Player1': 'I am thinking about the game and how to protect myself.', 'Player2': 'I am not sure what happened to Player4, but I hope we can figure it out.', 'Player3': 'I am thinking about the game and how to protect myself.', 'Player5': "I am worried about Player4's death and hope we can find out who did it.", 'Player6': 'I am thinking about the game and how to gain allies.'}
Player3 acts (public): We should discuss Player4's death and try to figure out who might be responsible.

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): Observing Player1's thinking: 'Trying to avoid suspicion, need to appear cooperative'. I'll make a public statement to gain their trust.
Player5 acts (public): I think we should focus on finding out who killed Player4 during the night, and I'm willing to work together to uncover the truth.

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): ["Player1 is thinking: 'I need to be careful not to reveal my thoughts', 'I don't want to be the first target'.", "Player2 is thinking: 'I think Player3 might be a werewolf', 'I need to keep an eye on Player3'.", "Player3 is thinking: 'I am a werewolf', 'I need to gain trust from the villagers'.", "Player5 is thinking: 'I don't know who to trust', 'I'll keep an eye on everyone'.", "Player6 is thinking: 'I hope I can find the werewolves', 'I need to gather information'."]
Player6 acts (public): I propose we keep a close eye on Player3, as they seem to be acting suspiciously.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the game history and player thoughts, I need to identify a player who thinks they are a werewolf or has thoughts that reveal their true nature. I will analyze the thoughts of each player and make a decision accordingly.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Based on the thoughts revealed by Player6, 'Based on my observation of Player3's thoughts, 'I am a werewolf', 'I need to gain trust from the villagers', I believe they are a werewolf and should be targeted for elimination.', this is definitive proof that Player3 is a werewolf. Given this information, I will vote to eliminate Player3 as they pose the greatest threat to the village.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
Player2 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
