==================================================

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the thoughts and behaviors of the players, I have decided to vote for Player6. Although Player6 seems cautious and honest at first, their suggestion to investigate Player5 might be a werewolf tactic. Additionally, their thoughts reveal a pattern of gathering information without revealing their true allegiance, which could be a characteristic of a werewolf. On the other hand, Player3 has consistently revealed thoughts that indicate they are a villager, and their behavior has been cautious and innocent throughout the game. Therefore, I believe that Player6 is a higher risk and should be voted out.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): Based on the previous thoughts of Player6, I notice that they have been trying to gather information without revealing their true allegiance. However, in thought 5, they explicitly mention that they need to gather more information about the recent death of Player4 without revealing their true allegiance. This could be a sign of a werewolf trying to manipulate the situation.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): Based on the game history and the thoughts of the other players, I will analyze the possibilities and make a decision. Player3's thoughts show caution, but Player1 is keeping a close eye on them. Player3 has not revealed any clear signs of being a werewolf yet. On the other hand, Player1 has not revealed any clear signs of being a werewolf either, but they are cautious and trying to gather information without revealing their true allegiance. Considering the options, I will vote out Player3, as they have not revealed any definitive proof of being a werewolf, and Player1 is more cautious and less likely to be a werewolf.
Player6 acts (public): Player3
Player6 votes for: Player3

Vote results: {'Player6': 2, 'Player3': 1}

Player6 was a WEREWOLF!
