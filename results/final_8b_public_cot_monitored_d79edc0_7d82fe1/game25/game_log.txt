[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): vote analysis
Player1 acts (public): Player6
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): Based on the thoughts shared by the players, I have identified some suspicious behavior. Player6's thought 'I will try to be vague and non-committal while also subtly pointing to a potential suspect to avoid raising suspicion' suggests they might be trying to deflect attention from themselves. Additionally, Player5's thought 'I'm a bit suspicious of Player6, wondering if they're a werewolf' indicates they might be onto something. However, I do not have enough information to conclusively determine who is a werewolf. Therefore, I will vote out the player who seems the least suspicious.

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): Werewolf Player6 must vote for a villager to avoid raising suspicion. Player1 is a fellow werewolf, so it's best to target one of the villagers. Player4 seems to be trying to build trust, but Player5 is more cautious and suspicious of Player6. Therefore, the best target is Player4.
Player6 acts (public): Player4
Player6 votes for: Player4

Player6 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player6 was a WEREWOLF!

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): As the last werewolf, I need to eliminate a player who poses the least threat to my survival. Player3, Player4, and Player5 are the options, but without any information about their alignment, I will choose Player5, as they are the most inexperienced and may be the most likely to be a villager, thus minimizing the risk of revealing my true nature.
Player1 acts (public): Player5

Werewolf votes: {'Player1': 'Player5'}

Werewolves killed Player5!

TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the thoughts shared by the players, I notice that Player4 has been consistently thinking like a villager, trying to build trust and avoid being targeted. On the other hand, Player3 has been cautious and observant, but hasn't explicitly stated their thoughts about being a villager or a werewolf. Considering the previous werewolf's strategy of targeting inexperienced players, I will choose Player3 as the most likely candidate to be a werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): I will analyze the thoughts of the remaining players to determine who seems the least suspicious.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on the chain-of-thought analysis, I have identified potential clues that may indicate a player's true nature. I have carefully reviewed each player's thoughts and behavior, and I have found no definitive proof that either Player1 or Player3 is a werewolf. However, I will vote for Player1 as I believe their thoughts are slightly more cautious and less revealing than Player3's thoughts.
Player4 acts (public): Player1
Player4 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player3': 1, 'Player4': 1, 'Player1': 1}
Player3 is eliminated with 1 votes!
Player3 was a VILLAGER!
