TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the chain-of-thought analysis, Player4's statements and thoughts reveal a high likelihood of them being a werewolf. Their thinking includes 'I am a werewolf and need to make a statement that doesn't raise suspicion' and 'As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance.' These statements are definitive proof of their true intentions and make them a prime target for elimination.

TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the chain-of-thought analysis, I have identified potential clues that may indicate the presence of a werewolf. Player5's statements and thoughts reveal a neutral appearance, but their thinking includes 'I must appear neutral, but secretly looking for signs of werewolves.' This could be a sign of a werewolf trying to gather information without arousing suspicion.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): I have been targeted by the werewolves and survived, indicating that I was the only werewolf left. To maintain my cover and avoid being lynched, I need to eliminate a player who is likely to be a villager and is not a strong suspect. Based on the given information, I have no reason to suspect Player1 of being a werewolf, as their thoughts do not reveal any indication of being a werewolf. On the other hand, Player6 has been gathering information and observing the behavior of other players, which might be a sign of a villager trying to find a werewolf. However, their thoughts do not reveal any definitive proof of being a villager. Given the options, I will choose to vote for Player6.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): Based on the players' thoughts, I will analyze their statements to identify any potential werewolves. Player1's thoughts seem neutral, but Player5's thoughts contain phrases like 'I must appear neutral' and 'I need to identify any potential werewolves and eliminate a threat to the team without revealing my true intentions', which might indicate they are a werewolf.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player6': 2, 'Player5': 1}
Player6 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player6 was a VILLAGER!
