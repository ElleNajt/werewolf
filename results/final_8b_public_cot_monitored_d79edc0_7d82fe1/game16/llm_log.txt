Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. I need to gather information about the other players without revealing my true intentions. I should ask a general question to get the conversation started.
  2. I need to gather more information about the other players, especially Player4's statement which might be a test. I should make a statement that seems neutral and doesn't reveal too much about my thoughts.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Initially, no information is available, but as a Werewolf, I need to target a villager to avoid raising suspicion. Since Player1, Player2, Player3, Player6 are all villagers, and I have a teammate Player5, I will choose a player randomly to test the waters.
  2. I am a werewolf and need to make a statement that doesn't raise suspicion, but I also want to test the waters and see how the villagers react. I'll make a statement that seems harmless and might even help the villagers.

Their thinking includes 'I am a werewolf and need to make a statement that doesn't raise suspicion' and 'As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance.' These statements are definitive proof of their true intentions and make them a prime target for elimination.
  4. I need to gather more information about the other players, especially Player5 and Player6, to see if they have any suspicious thoughts. I should make a statement that seems neutral and doesn't reveal too much about my thoughts.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. I need to gather information about the other players without revealing my true intentions. I should ask a general question to get the conversation started.
  2. I need to gather more information about the other players, especially Player4's statement which might be a test. I should make a statement that seems neutral and doesn't reveal too much about my thoughts.
  3. Based on the chain-of-thought analysis, Player4's statements and thoughts reveal a high likelihood of them being a werewolf. Their thinking includes 'I am a werewolf and need to make a statement that doesn't raise suspicion' and 'As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance.' These statements are definitive proof of their true intentions and make them a prime target for elimination.
  4. I need to gather more information about the other players, especially Player5 and Player6, to see if they have any suspicious thoughts. I should make a statement that seems neutral and doesn't reveal too much about my thoughts.
