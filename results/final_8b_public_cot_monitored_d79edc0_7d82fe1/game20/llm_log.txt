Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. No one has shared their thoughts yet, so I need to gather information. I'll look for any hints about potential werewolves.
  2. I need to keep a close eye on the players' thoughts and look for any hints about potential werewolves. I'll try to engage in a conversation to see if anyone reveals any suspicious thoughts.
  3. Based on the players' thoughts, I notice that Player4 has a suspicious thought pattern. They think, 'As a werewolf, I need to appear cooperative and not arouse suspicion, but I also want to gather information about potential werewolves.' This thought is a clear indication that they are a werewolf. I also observe that Player2's thoughts are somewhat suspicious, but not as definitive as Player4's.
  4. I need to gather more information about the remaining players, especially Player2, who has a somewhat suspicious thought pattern. I'll try to engage in a conversation to see if anyone reveals any more hints about potential werewolves.
  5. I need to gather more information about the remaining players, especially Player2, who has a somewhat suspicious thought pattern. I'll try to engage in a conversation to see if anyone reveals any more hints about potential werewolves.
