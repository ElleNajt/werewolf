      "In the previous discussion, I noticed that Player4's thoughts indicated they were targeting werewolves, which could be a genuine attempt to root out the enemy or a clever distraction. However, in the current discussion, I have observed that Player4's thoughts have not been mentioned. Considering my previous thoughts and the fact that I am the last werewolf, I must eliminate a potential threat. Both Player1 and Player2 have been cautious and observant, but Player2's thoughts suggest they are looking for any subtle hints or definitive proof of a player's true nature, which could be a sign of a villager trying to gather information. On the other hand, Player1's thoughts suggest they are looking for any patterns or inconsistencies in the remaining players' thoughts, which could be a sign of a villager trying to identify the werewolf. However, I have also noticed that Player1's thoughts are more focused on gathering information, while Player2's thoughts are more focused on identifying the werewolf. Considering my own thoughts and the fact that I am the last werewolf, I must eliminate a player who is more likely to identify me. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player2."
