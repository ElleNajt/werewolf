TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): I am a werewolf, and I need to avoid raising suspicion. I'll target Player2, but publicly suggest that they be cautious and consider alliances.
Player1 acts (public): Let's be cautious and consider forming alliances to increase our chances of survival.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): I am Player2, a villager. I need to gather information without arousing suspicion.

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)

Player4 acts (public): Let's focus on gathering information and watching each other's actions to figure out who might be the werewolves.

Player5 acts (public): Let's focus on getting to know each other better and finding out who might have information about Player3's death. Maybe we can figure out who might be a threat to us.

Player6 thinks (public): [thinking: 'I need to gather information about the other players', 'I should try to make alliances', 'I wonder if anyone else suspects Player3 was a werewolf']
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to start by saying that we should discuss the death of Player3 and try to figure out who might have done it. I'm open to forming alliances with anyone who seems trustworthy.

==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
