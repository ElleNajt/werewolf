Player1 acts (public): I think we should be cautious and not vote anyone out yet, we don't know who the werewolves are.

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): I need to appear as a concerned villager while keeping an eye on potential werewolves without arousing suspicion. I will look for players who might be thinking about werewolves.
Player2 acts (public): I'm glad we're able to discuss and figure out what happened to Player6 last night. We should be careful and try to uncover the truth about what's going on.

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): [thinking: I'm a villager, I need to be careful not to arouse suspicion. I'll make a neutral statement to see how the others react.]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): [{'Player1': "thinking: I'm a little nervous about the recent death, but I don't think anyone suspicious has spoken up yet.", 'Player2': "thinking: I'm trying to appear confident and calm, but I'm secretly wondering if there's a werewolf among us.", 'Player3': "thinking: I'm not sure what to make of the situation, but I'm going to try to stay neutral for now.", 'Player4': "thinking: I'm a villager, I need to find out who the werewolves are and convince the others to vote them out.", 'Player5': "thinking: I'm thinking about making a speech to try and rally the group, but I'm not sure if it will be effective."}]
Player4 acts (public): I think we should be cautious and gather more information before making any decisions. Let's hear from everyone and see if anyone has any suspicions.

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): I must appear as a villager, make a non-suspicious statement, and try to gather information about Player2's thoughts. I will not reveal my true nature, and I will observe Player2's reaction to see if they make any suspicious statements.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss the recent events and try to figure out who might have been involved in Player6's death. Let's focus on gathering information and not jumping to conclusions.
