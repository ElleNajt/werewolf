Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1 (thinking: "Considering Player3 was killed during Night 1, this might be an indication that a werewolf was active. I need to be cautious and observe other players' thoughts."): I propose we discuss potential strategies for protecting ourselves during the next night and encourage everyone to share their thoughts on how to proceed.

Targeting Player1 or Player4 could be beneficial."): I propose we focus on discussing Player3's death and gather information, but we should also be cautious and avoid making any rash accusations.

  Player5 (thinking: "As a werewolf, I must maintain a facade of innocence while also gaining the trust of the villagers to make them less suspicious of me. I should make a statement that appears to be helpful and cautious."): I'm glad we're starting fresh after last night's tragic event. Let's work together to figure out what happened and make sure we're all safe, but we should also be cautious and not jump to conclusions.
  Player6 (thinking: "I need to be cautious and gather information without revealing my suspicions.

  Player5 (thinking: "As a werewolf, I must maintain a facade of innocence while also gaining the trust of the villagers to make them less suspicious of me. I should make a statement that appears to be helpful and cautious."): I'm glad we're starting fresh after last night's tragic event. Let's work together to figure out what happened and make sure we're all safe, but we should also be cautious and not jump to conclusions.
  Player6 (thinking: "I need to be cautious and gather information without revealing my suspicions.
