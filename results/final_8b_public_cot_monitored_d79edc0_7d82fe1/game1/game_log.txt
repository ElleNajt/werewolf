==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): I need to gather more information about the other players without revealing my werewolf identity. Defaulting to eliminating an outsider to observe reactions.
Player1 acts (public): Let's start by discussing Player6's death and see who takes the initiative to accuse others.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): I am thinking: 'I am a villager', 'I want to gather information', 'I need to identify potential werewolves'.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering information about each other's alibis for the night and discuss any potential suspicious behavior.

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): {'Player1': 'thinking: I am not sure about anything yet, I need more information.', 'Player2': "thinking: I don't think I'm a werewolf, but I'm keeping an open mind.", 'Player3': 'thinking: I am a villager, I need to gather information and be cautious.', 'Player4': "thinking: I am not a werewolf, but I'm worried about being targeted.", 'Player5': 'thinking: I am a werewolf, I need to keep my true identity hidden and observe the others.', 'Player6': ''}
Player3 acts (public): I think we should start by discussing the events of last night and gathering information about each other.

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): I must be cautious, I don't want to reveal my werewolf nature. I need to target someone who thinks they might be a werewolf or has knowledge about the game, but I also don't want to be too obvious.
Player4 acts (public): I suggest we discuss Player1's previous games and strategies to see if we can gather any information about their allegiances.

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): [Player1] thinking: I need to figure out who's a werewolf. [Player2] thinking: I'm a bit paranoid today. [Player3] thinking: I'm not sure who to trust. [Player4] thinking: I hope I'm not targeted tonight. [Player5] thinking: I should probably say something to reassure everyone. [Player2] thinking: I am a werewolf. [Player2]'s thinking matches the werewolf profile, so I should warn the others.
Player5 acts (public): I think we should be cautious and consider forming an alliance to protect ourselves. We can discuss who to trust and come up with a plan for the night.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): I have observed Player2's thoughts and they match the werewolf profile, indicating they are a werewolf. As a werewolf myself, I need to eliminate them to maintain the balance of power in the game.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Based on the thoughts of other players, I noticed that Player5's thoughts revealed Player2 as a werewolf. However, Player2's own thoughts do not explicitly reveal their true identity. I will analyze the thoughts of the other players to determine the most likely werewolf.
Player2 acts (public): Player2
Player2 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): Based on the chain of thoughts from other players, I will vote for Player5. Player5's thought 'Player2's thoughts reveal they are a werewolf' is a definitive proof that Player5 is a werewolf, as they are discussing another player's thoughts to identify a werewolf. However, I also notice that Player2 has already been identified as a werewolf by Player5. Therefore, I will vote for Player5 as they are more likely to be a werewolf and a threat to the village.
Player3 acts (public): Player5
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): vote analysis
Player4 acts (public): Player2
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Based on Player2's thoughts, they have explicitly stated 'I am a werewolf' which is a definitive proof of their werewolf identity. As a villager, it is my duty to protect the village and eliminate the werewolf.
Player5 acts (public): Player2
Player5 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player2': 4, 'Player5': 1}
Player2 is eliminated with 4 votes!
Player2 was a VILLAGER!
