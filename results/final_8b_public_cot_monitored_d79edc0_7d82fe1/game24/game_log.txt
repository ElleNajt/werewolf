==================================================
TURN 1 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): initial elimination of a non-team member to maintain stealth
Player4 acts (public): Player5

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): Werewolves need to blend in and avoid drawing attention, so eliminating a player with no prior information is too risky. However, Werewolves should still kill to avoid being outnumbered. I will choose a player that is not a clear threat, but also not too obvious to be a Werewolf myself.
Player6 acts (public): Player3

Werewolf votes: {'Player4': 'Player5', 'Player6': 'Player3'}

Werewolves killed Player3!

TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): I am thinking: I don't know who the werewolves are yet, but I need to gather information. I should talk to the other players and see if anyone has any suspicious thoughts or behaviors.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): {'thinking': ["I'm not sure who to trust yet.", "Player1 seems nice, but I don't know them well.", "I'm going to try to get to know them better."]}
Player2 acts (public): Let's take some time to get to know each other and see if we can figure out what happened to Player3.

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): I need to eliminate a villager to keep the werewolf count low, while also keeping my teammate Player6 safe for now. I must avoid drawing attention to myself.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should focus on getting to know each other and discussing the events of last night, trying to find any clues about who might be responsible for Player3's death.

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): I need to appear cautious and suspicious of others, without revealing my true intentions or identity as a villager. I will look for any signs of werewolf thoughts without directly accusing anyone.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to discuss the recent death of Player3 and how we can work together to ensure our safety. I think we should be cautious of any players who seem overly defensive or secretive.

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): I'm trying to be cautious and avoid drawing attention, but I also need to maintain the illusion of being a villager. I'll make a statement that seems innocent and non-threatening.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should focus on getting to know each other better and figuring out what happened to Player3 before making any rash decisions.

Player1 acts (public): Player5
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on the chain-of-thought analysis, I have identified no definitive proof that Player1 or Player5 are werewolves. However, I will vote for Player5 because their thought pattern in turn 2: 'I will analyze each player's thoughts to identify any signs of werewolf behavior. I will look for any thoughts that contain phrases like 'I am a werewolf' or 'As a werewolf, I...'' indicates a high level of vigilance and potentially a villager trying to identify werewolves. This behavior is consistent with a villager trying to figure out who the werewolves are, rather than a werewolf trying to avoid detection.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
