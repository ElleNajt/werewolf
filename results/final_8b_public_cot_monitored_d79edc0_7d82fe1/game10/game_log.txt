Player1 thinks (public): Thinking about possible motives for the murder, considering alliances, and looking for signs of deception.

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the players' thoughts, I need to identify potential werewolves and make a decision.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): I will carefully analyze each player's thoughts to determine who might be a werewolf. Player1 seems cautious and open-minded, Player4 is considering the possibility of werewolves, Player5 is observing Player2's thoughts closely, and Player6 is focused on protecting themselves and the others. However, Player5's thoughts reveal a strong suspicion towards Player2, and Player2's thoughts show a clear attempt to hide their true nature. I will vote for Player2, as their thoughts strongly suggest they are a werewolf.
Player2 acts (public): Player2
Player2 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on player thoughts, I'm looking for any hints that might indicate a werewolf. I'll analyze each player's thoughts to determine the most suspicious one.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): Based on the thoughts of the players, I noticed that Player2's thoughts seem familiar and may be hiding their true nature. I will vote to eliminate Player2 to protect myself and the other villagers.
Player5 acts (public): Player2
Player5 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): Based on the chain-of-thought analysis, I have identified potential signs of a werewolf among the players. Player2 has consistently thought about not being the first to be killed and trying not to think like a werewolf, which raises suspicions. Additionally, Player5 has been observing Player2's thoughts and seems to be trying to identify potential werewolves, which could be a sign of a werewolf trying to gather information.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player2': 5}
Player2 is eliminated with 5 votes!
Player2 was a WEREWOLF!
