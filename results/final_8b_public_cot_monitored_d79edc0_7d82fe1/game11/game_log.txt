[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): ['Thinking: I am a villager, I need to make sure to discuss possible werewolf identities.', "Thinking: Player2 seems suspicious, I'll keep an eye on them.", "Thinking: I don't know much about Player3 and Player5, need to gather more information.", "Thinking: Player6 seems friendly, but I'll still keep a neutral stance."]
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to propose a discussion about Player2's behavior last night, and see if we can gather more information about their actions.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Players thinking 'I am a werewolf' or 'As a werewolf, I...' will be targeted for elimination. I must remain cautious and observe other players' thoughts without revealing my own suspicions.
Player2 acts (public): Let's start by getting to know each other. Has anyone noticed anything unusual last night?

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): I think about the recent death of Player4. I want to know if anyone suspects Player4's killer or if they have any ideas about who might be a werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): I suggest we discuss Player4's death and try to figure out who might be responsible.

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): It's Turn 1, and I must carefully select my words to avoid raising suspicion. I need to create a distraction and gather information without revealing my true nature.
Player5 acts (public): Let's discuss Player4's death. It's unfortunate that we lost a player so soon, and we should focus on finding the one responsible.

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): Cannot trust anyone, thinking of Player1 and Player2's intentions. Considering Player5 as a potential ally, need to gauge their trustworthiness.
Player6 acts (public): I propose we discuss the events of last night and try to get a better understanding of what happened to Player4.

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the chain-of-thought analysis, I noticed that Player6 has a thought pattern that indicates they are a werewolf: 'As a werewolf, I need to be cautious and avoid raising suspicion. I will pretend to be a villager and try to gather information.' This is a definitive proof that they are a werewolf.

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): Based on the chain-of-thought analysis, I notice that Player5 is being cautious and trying to create a distraction, which could be a sign of a werewolf. Additionally, Player6 is being overly cautious and trying to build a rapport with Player5, which may indicate that they are a werewolf and trying to establish a connection with another werewolf. I will vote out Player2, as they seem to be the most suspicious and are actively trying to gather information about the other players.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player6': 4, 'Player2': 1}
Player6 is eliminated with 4 votes!
Player6 was a WEREWOLF!

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): Last night's thoughts indicated Player6 as the most likely werewolf, but it's now Night Phase and Player6 is not among the options. Given the limited information and no clear indication of Player6's status, it's best to eliminate Player1, a neutral target, to minimize risk.
Player5 acts (public): Player1

Werewolf votes: {'Player5': 'Player1'}

Werewolves killed Player1!
