--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): I am a villager, I need to gain allies and information to figure out who the werewolves are. I will try to be friendly and non-confrontational to avoid raising suspicions.
Player1 acts (public): Hello everyone, let's work together to figure out what happened to Player5. I'm open to discussing any ideas or suspicions we may have.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): ["Player1 thinks: I'm not sure who to trust, but I think we should talk about Player5's death.", "Player2 thinks: I'm just a normal villager, I don't know anything about Player5's death.", 'Player3 thinks: Maybe Player5 was killed by a werewolf, we should be careful.', "Player4 thinks: I'm so scared, what if I'm next?", "Player6 thinks: I'm not sure who to vote out, I need more information.", 'Player1 is thinking: As a villager, I should be cautious and not jump to conclusions, but I also need to figure out who to trust.', 'Player2 is thinking: I am a villager, I have no idea who could be a werewolf.', "Player3 is thinking: If I'm a werewolf, I need to blend in and not draw attention to myself.", "Player4 is thinking: Oh no, I hope I'm not a werewolf, that would be terrible.", 'Player6 is thinking: I am a werewolf, I need to find a way to get rid of the other villagers.']
Player2 acts (public): We should discuss Player5's death and try to figure out who might be a werewolf, but we should also be careful not to accuse anyone unfairly.

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): {'Player1': 'I am not a werewolf, I am just curious about the game.', 'Player2': 'I am not sure who to trust, but I want to gather information.', 'Player3': 'I am a villager, I want to figure out who the werewolves are.', 'Player4': 'I am a bit scared, but I want to try to make friends.', 'Player6': 'I am not sure what is going on, but I want to survive.'}
Player3 acts (public): Let's all start fresh, I propose we discuss our strategies and try to figure out who might be a werewolf.

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): I'm a werewolf, and I need to protect my fellow werewolf, Player6. I'll try to distract attention from Player6 and create confusion.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to propose a vote on Player2, as they seem like a neutral option and may be a werewolf, but I'm not sure.

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): Preserve teammate, eliminate potential threat. Monitor Player4's behavior for any signs of suspicious activity.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should focus on finding out who could be the werewolf, rather than accusing anyone immediately.

Player1 thinks (public): I am a villager, I need to gain allies and information to figure out who the werewolves are. I will try to be friendly and non-confrontational to avoid raising suspicions. Player4's proposal to vote out Player2 seems suspicious, as it may be a distraction to protect Player6.
Player1 acts (public): I suggest we focus on gathering more information before making any decisions, and we should be cautious of any players who may be trying to create confusion.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): I think Player4 is trying to distract us from Player6 by proposing a vote on me, but I'm not sure if Player4 is a werewolf or just trying to manipulate the conversation.

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): vote analysis
Player1 acts (public): Player2
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Based on the thoughts of the players, I notice that Player6 is thinking 'I am a werewolf, I need to find a way to get rid of the other villagers.' This is a definitive proof that Player6 is a werewolf.
Player2 acts (public): Player6
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): I will analyze the thoughts of each player to identify any potential werewolves.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): I will vote for Player2 because their thought suggests they are suspicious of Player4 and my true thoughts reveal I am a werewolf, which means Player2 may be a villager trying to figure out who the werewolves are and could be a threat to me and my fellow werewolf, Player6. I need to eliminate Player2 to protect my fellow werewolf and maintain our position in the game.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): I am a werewolf, and I need to protect my fellow werewolf, Player4. Based on the discussion, it seems like Player2 is suspicious and may be a potential threat to eliminate. However, I will not directly accuse Player2, as it may raise suspicions about my own identity.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player2': 3, 'Player6': 1, 'Player4': 1}
Player2 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player2 was a VILLAGER!
