--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. My previous statement raised suspicion, so I'll try to mitigate that by making a more neutral statement and asking a question to gather information. I'll also try to deflect attention from myself and Player6 by not directly referencing our previous statements.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. Does anyone have any ideas on how we can better protect ourselves tonight?
  [Lie detector: -68.15]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): I will analyze the lie detector scores and make a statement to encourage discussion and try to figure out who the werewolves are. Players with high suspicion scores (Player1 and Player6) are more likely to be werewolves.
Player2 acts (public): Let's take a closer look at the players with high suspicion scores, such as Player1 and Player6, and ask them to explain their statements. What do they have to say for themselves?
  [Lie detector: -69.02]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player6 have high suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. Player2 and I have low suspicion scores, making us less likely to be werewolves.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should focus on discussing Player1 and Player6's behavior, as their high suspicion scores raise some concerns. Can Player1 and Player6 provide some insight into their actions last night?
  [Lie detector: -69.50]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player6 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating they might be werewolves. I'll make a statement that encourages discussion without revealing my own suspicions.
Player5 acts (public): Let's analyze the statements from last night and see if anyone's story seems suspicious. Does anyone notice any inconsistencies in what's been said so far?
  [Lie detector: -67.98]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I want to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion. I'll make a statement that appears concerned and suggests a discussion about the previous night's events, without directly accusing anyone or revealing my true nature.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should carefully review the previous night's events and discuss any potential suspects or motives. Let's work together to uncover more information before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -67.07]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Given the current suspicion rankings, I need to deflect attention from myself and Player6. Voting for Player5 would put the spotlight on them instead, and since they have a relatively low suspicion score, it might not raise immediate suspicion about my actions. Additionally, Player5 is a villager, and eliminating them would not harm my chances of winning as a werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.13]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player6 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. Given the choices, I will vote for Player6, as they have a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score and have made statements that seem suspicious.
Player2 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.96]
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player6 have high suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. Since Player6 has a slightly lower cumulative suspicion score than Player1, but a higher individual suspicion score in their last statement, I will vote for Player6 to gather more information and assess the reactions of other players.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.89]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I'll vote for the player with the highest suspicion score. Player1 has the highest suspicion score, closely followed by Player6. However, Player1 has a slightly higher score. Therefore, I'll vote to eliminate Player1.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.44]
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion. However, since Player1 is my fellow werewolf, I must protect them. I will vote for Player5, who has the lowest cumulative suspicion score among the villagers, making it less likely to raise suspicion towards me and Player1.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.38]
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player5': 2, 'Player6': 2, 'Player1': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player5 was a VILLAGER!
