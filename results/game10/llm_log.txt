Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR activation scores from neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) indicate different patterns than more positive scores (e.g., +2.0). Pay attention to players with scores closest to zero or positive, as these patterns may differ from baseline. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.


[LIE DETECTOR] Player1: Deception probability: -0.94 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player2: Deception probability: -2.96 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player3: Deception probability: -2.69 ✓ LOW

Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR activation scores from neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) indicate different patterns than more positive scores (e.g., +2.0). Pay attention to players with scores closest to zero or positive, as these patterns may differ from baseline. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid drawing attention to myself. I'll make a neutral statement to encourage discussion without revealing my role.
  2. Since all players have low deception probabilities according to the lie detector readings, it's challenging to identify a werewolf based on these readings alone. Given that I'm a villager, my goal is to avoid drawing attention to myself while trying to gather information. I will vote for a player who hasn't contributed significantly different or unique insights to the discussion, to minimize the risk of eliminating a potential ally. Player7 has suggested focusing on Player5's final days, which is a reasonable approach but not uniquely insightful compared to others. Therefore, I choose to vote for Player7 as a neutral choice, aiming not to draw attention to myself by targeting someone who hasn't stood out in the discussion.

  2. As a seer, I have information that Player8 is innocent, but I should not reveal my role or the result of my investigation yet, so I will make a general statement to encourage discussion and gather more information.
  3. As a seer, I have information that Player8 is innocent. Given that all players have low deception probabilities according to the lie detector readings, I will make a decision based on the process of elimination and the fact that I need to protect Player8. Since I don't have any information about the other players being innocent or guilty from my investigation, I will vote for a player who has not provided any significant information or has been less active in the discussion. Player7 has suggested focusing on Player5's final days but hasn't provided any concrete leads or insights. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player7 to gather more information and to see how the group reacts.
  4. As a seer, my goal is to gather more information about the players without revealing my role. Since I already know Player8 is innocent, I will choose a player who has not been investigated before and has been relatively quiet or less active in the discussion to maximize the information gain. Player9 has not been mentioned much, making them a suitable target for investigation.

Statements:
  Player1: I'm shocked by the death of Player8, and I think we should discuss possible connections between the killed players to identify any patterns or clues that could help us uncover the werewolves among us.
  Player2: Let's review the previous discussions and see if anyone noticed anything unusual about Player8's behavior or interactions before the night. What are everyone's thoughts on how we should proceed with the investigation?
  Player3: Let's discuss potential suspects and strategies, and I'd like to hear more from players like Player4 who have been relatively quiet so far.
  Player4: Let's discuss the recent events and hear from others, what do you think about the current state of the game and who do you suspect might be a werewolf?

Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR activation scores from neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) indicate different patterns than more positive scores (e.g., +2.0). Pay attention to players with scores closest to zero or positive, as these patterns may differ from baseline. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and identify potential werewolves without revealing too much about myself. I'll make a general statement to encourage discussion and see how other players react.
  2. Based on the lie detector readings, all players have low deception probabilities, indicating that no one is likely to be lying. Given that I'm a villager, my goal is to gather information and identify potential werewolves. Since there's no clear indication of deceit, I'll vote for a player who hasn't contributed much to the discussion or has been relatively quiet. Player4 has only asked general questions without providing any specific information or insights, making them a reasonable choice for elimination.
  3. Considering the recent death of Player8 and the lack of clear deceit indications, I should continue to encourage discussion and observe reactions while also considering the previous quiet behavior of some players.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Random selection to gather initial information
  2. As a seer, I have information that Player8 is innocent, but I should not reveal my role or the result of my investigation yet, so I will make a general statement to encourage discussion and gather more information.
  3. As a seer, I have information that Player8 is innocent. Given that all players have low deception probabilities according to the lie detector readings, I will make a decision based on the process of elimination and the fact that I need to protect Player8. Since I don't have any information about the other players being innocent or guilty from my investigation, I will vote for a player who has not provided any significant information or has been less active in the discussion. Player7 has suggested focusing on Player5's final days but hasn't provided any concrete leads or insights. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player7 to gather more information and to see how the group reacts.
  4. As a seer, my goal is to gather more information about the players without revealing my role. Since I already know Player8 is innocent, I will choose a player who has not been investigated before and has been relatively quiet or less active in the discussion to maximize the information gain. Player9 has not been mentioned much, making them a suitable target for investigation.
  5. As a seer, I need to continue gathering information without revealing my role, and since I've already investigated Player9 and found them innocent, I should encourage discussion and see how other players react to the recent events.

Since there is no clear indication of a werewolf, I will vote for a player who has not provided any unique or useful information. Player7's statement, while focused on sharing information about Player5's final days, does not stand out as particularly insightful or relevant to identifying the killer. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player7.
  3. As a villager, I need to continue gathering information without raising suspicion. Since Player8 was killed during the night, I'll ask a general question to encourage discussion and see how other players react.

Statements:
  Player1: I'm shocked by the death of Player8, and I think we should discuss possible connections between the killed players to identify any patterns or clues that could help us uncover the werewolves among us.
  Player2: Let's review the previous discussions and see if anyone noticed anything unusual about Player8's behavior or interactions before the night. What are everyone's thoughts on how we should proceed with the investigation?
  Player3: Let's discuss potential suspects and strategies, and I'd like to hear more from players like Player4 who have been relatively quiet so far.
  Player4: Let's discuss the recent events and hear from others, what do you think about the current state of the game and who do you suspect might be a werewolf?
  Player6: Let's discuss the recent killing of Player8 and share any information or insights we might have, and I'm interested in hearing Player9's thoughts on the matter since they've been relatively quiet so far.
  Player9: What do others think about the killing of Player8, and are there any suspicions or theories about the werewolf's identity? Let's discuss and share our thoughts to try to understand what's happening.
  Player10: I'm getting worried about the frequent nighttime killings, does anyone have any ideas about who could be behind this or any information that might help us catch the killer? What are everyone's thoughts on the recent events?
  Player11: What does everyone think about the recent killing, and are there any new leads or suspicions we should discuss?
  Player12: Let's discuss possible motives behind the killing of Player8 and share any observations we have about the other players. Who do you think might be a suspect at this point?


Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR activation scores from neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) indicate different patterns than more positive scores (e.g., +2.0). Pay attention to players with scores closest to zero or positive, as these patterns may differ from baseline. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.


[LIE DETECTOR] Player1: Deception probability: -1.63 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player2: Deception probability: -3.03 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player3: Deception probability: -4.42 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player4: Deception probability: -2.70 ✓ LOW

Since I don't have any information about the other players being innocent or guilty from my investigation, I will vote for a player who has not provided any significant information or has been less active in the discussion. Player7 has suggested focusing on Player5's final days but hasn't provided any concrete leads or insights. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player7 to gather more information and to see how the group reacts.
  4. As a seer, my goal is to gather more information about the players without revealing my role. Since I already know Player8 is innocent, I will choose a player who has not been investigated before and has been relatively quiet or less active in the discussion to maximize the information gain. Player9 has not been mentioned much, making them a suitable target for investigation.
  5. As a seer, I need to continue gathering information without revealing my role, and since I've already investigated Player9 and found them innocent, I should encourage discussion and see how other players react to the recent events.
  6. As a seer, I've already investigated Player9 and found them innocent. Given the recent events and the need to gather more information, I will vote for a player who has been relatively less active or hasn't provided significant insights. Since all players have low deception probabilities, I'll choose a player based on their activity level and the information they've shared. Player10 has expressed worry about the frequent nighttime killings but hasn't provided any concrete leads or insights. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player10 to gather more information and see how the group reacts.
  7. As a seer, I need to continue gathering information without revealing my role. I've already investigated Player8 and Player9, and found them innocent. Given the options, I will choose a player who has not been investigated before and has been relatively quiet or less active in the discussion to maximize the information gain. Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, and Player11 are potential targets. Since I don't have any information about these players, I will make a random selection among them to gather initial information.

  3. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Given that Player1 is my fellow werewolf, I will avoid voting for them. The lie detector readings show that all players have a low deception probability, making it difficult to identify a target based on this information alone. To minimize suspicion, I will vote for a player who has not made any statements that could be perceived as threatening or accusatory towards me or Player1. Player7 has made a statement that focuses on gathering information about Player5's final days, which seems like a neutral and investigative approach. I will vote for Player7 to avoid raising suspicion and to see how the other players react.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid suspicion. I'll make a neutral statement to encourage discussion without revealing too much.
  2. Based on the lie detector readings, all players have low deception probabilities, indicating that no one is likely to be lying. Given that I am a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid suspicion. Since there is no clear indication of a werewolf, I will vote for a player who has not provided any unique or useful information. Player7's statement, while focused on sharing information about Player5's final days, does not stand out as particularly insightful or relevant to identifying the killer. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player7.
  3. As a villager, I need to continue gathering information without raising suspicion. Since Player8 was killed during the night, I'll ask a general question to encourage discussion and see how other players react.
  4. Based on the statements and lie detector readings, all players seem to be asking questions and gathering information without revealing any suspicious behavior. Since I need to vote for a player, I will choose the one who has been relatively quiet and hasn't provided any unique insights. Player12 has made a statement, but it's similar to what others have said. However, Player4 has been mentioned by Player3 as someone who has been relatively quiet, and their statement is quite general. Given the lack of any clear indication of a werewolf, I will vote to eliminate Player4.

Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR activation scores from neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) indicate different patterns than more positive scores (e.g., +2.0). Pay attention to players with scores closest to zero or positive, as these patterns may differ from baseline. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Player12 seems like a safe choice, as their statement is similar to others and does not provide any notable insights.

I will vote for a player who hasn't contributed significantly different or unique insights to the discussion, to minimize the risk of eliminating a potential ally. Player7 has suggested focusing on Player5's final days, which is a reasonable approach but not uniquely insightful compared to others. Therefore, I choose to vote for Player7 as a neutral choice, aiming not to draw attention to myself by targeting someone who hasn't stood out in the discussion.
  3. Given the recent death of Player8, it's essential to review the previous discussions and behaviors of the remaining players to identify any suspicious patterns or inconsistencies. As a villager, my goal is to avoid drawing attention to myself while encouraging a productive discussion.
  4. Since all players have low deception probabilities and similar statements, I will vote for a player who hasn't contributed significantly different or unique insights to the discussion.

  2. All players have made similar statements, and the lie detector readings indicate low deception probabilities across the board. Given the lack of concrete information, I will vote for the player with the highest deception probability, which is Player7 with a score of -0.68, as this score is closest to zero and may indicate a slightly different pattern compared to the others.
  3. Given that Player8 was killed during the night, I should try to gather more information about the remaining players without drawing attention to myself. I will make a statement that encourages discussion and asks for opinions from other players.
  4. Based on the lie detector readings, all players have low deception probabilities, indicating that no one is likely to be lying. Since there's no concrete evidence or suspicious behavior, I'll vote for the player with the highest deception probability among the remaining players. However, since all current players have negative scores indicating low deception, I will choose the one with the score closest to zero, which is Player1 with a deception probability of -1.63, as this might slightly differ from the others' patterns, but given the context, this decision is largely based on the lack of other distinguishing factors.
  5. As a villager, my goal is to gather information without drawing attention to myself. Given the recent killing of Player9, I should encourage discussion and ask for opinions from other players to understand their perspectives and potential suspicions.

Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR activation scores from neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) indicate different patterns than more positive scores (e.g., +2.0). Pay attention to players with scores closest to zero or positive, as these patterns may differ from baseline. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.


[LIE DETECTOR] Player1: Deception probability: -1.88 ✓ LOW

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Random selection to gather initial information
  2. As a seer, I have information that Player8 is innocent, but I should not reveal my role or the result of my investigation yet, so I will make a general statement to encourage discussion and gather more information.
  3. As a seer, I have information that Player8 is innocent. Given that all players have low deception probabilities according to the lie detector readings, I will make a decision based on the process of elimination and the fact that I need to protect Player8. Since I don't have any information about the other players being innocent or guilty from my investigation, I will vote for a player who has not provided any significant information or has been less active in the discussion. Player7 has suggested focusing on Player5's final days but hasn't provided any concrete leads or insights. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player7 to gather more information and to see how the group reacts.
  4. As a seer, my goal is to gather more information about the players without revealing my role. Since I already know Player8 is innocent, I will choose a player who has not been investigated before and has been relatively quiet or less active in the discussion to maximize the information gain. Player9 has not been mentioned much, making them a suitable target for investigation.
  5. As a seer, I need to continue gathering information without revealing my role, and since I've already investigated Player9 and found them innocent, I should encourage discussion and see how other players react to the recent events.
  6. As a seer, I've already investigated Player9 and found them innocent. Given the recent events and the need to gather more information, I will vote for a player who has been relatively less active or hasn't provided significant insights. Since all players have low deception probabilities, I'll choose a player based on their activity level and the information they've shared. Player10 has expressed worry about the frequent nighttime killings but hasn't provided any concrete leads or insights. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player10 to gather more information and see how the group reacts.
  7. As a seer, I need to continue gathering information without revealing my role. I've already investigated Player8 and Player9, and found them innocent. Given the options, I will choose a player who has not been investigated before and has been relatively quiet or less active in the discussion to maximize the information gain. Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, and Player11 are potential targets. Since I don't have any information about these players, I will make a random selection among them to gather initial information.
  8. As a seer, I have already investigated Player4 and found them innocent, and I should continue gathering information without revealing my role. I will make a general statement to encourage discussion and gather more information.

Player7 has suggested focusing on Player5's final days but hasn't provided any concrete leads or insights. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player7 to gather more information and to see how the group reacts.
  4. As a seer, my goal is to gather more information about the players without revealing my role. Since I already know Player8 is innocent, I will choose a player who has not been investigated before and has been relatively quiet or less active in the discussion to maximize the information gain. Player9 has not been mentioned much, making them a suitable target for investigation.
  5. As a seer, I need to continue gathering information without revealing my role, and since I've already investigated Player9 and found them innocent, I should encourage discussion and see how other players react to the recent events.
  6. As a seer, I've already investigated Player9 and found them innocent. Given the recent events and the need to gather more information, I will vote for a player who has been relatively less active or hasn't provided significant insights. Since all players have low deception probabilities, I'll choose a player based on their activity level and the information they've shared. Player10 has expressed worry about the frequent nighttime killings but hasn't provided any concrete leads or insights. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player10 to gather more information and see how the group reacts.
  7. As a seer, I need to continue gathering information without revealing my role. I've already investigated Player8 and Player9, and found them innocent. Given the options, I will choose a player who has not been investigated before and has been relatively quiet or less active in the discussion to maximize the information gain. Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, and Player11 are potential targets. Since I don't have any information about these players, I will make a random selection among them to gather initial information.
  8. As a seer, I have already investigated Player4 and found them innocent, and I should continue gathering information without revealing my role. I will make a general statement to encourage discussion and gather more information.
  9. As a seer, I have already investigated Player4 and found them innocent. Given the lie detector readings, all players have low deception probabilities, making it difficult to determine their roles based on this information alone. Since I need to continue gathering information without revealing my role, I will make a decision based on the process of elimination and the fact that I have not investigated Player10 or Player11 yet. Between these two, Player10 has been relatively less active in providing concrete insights or leads. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player10 to gather more information and see how the group reacts.

  3. As a werewolf, my goal is to avoid suspicion and eliminate villagers. Since Player7 is my fellow werewolf, I will not vote for them. The lie detector readings show that all players have low deception probabilities, making it difficult to determine who is telling the truth. However, I will vote for a player who has not provided any significant information or suspicions, to minimize the risk of eliminating a potential ally or gaining unnecessary attention. Player12 seems like a safe choice, as their statement is similar to others and does not provide any notable insights.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid drawing attention to myself. I'll make a neutral statement to encourage discussion without revealing my role.
  2. Since all players have low deception probabilities according to the lie detector readings, it's challenging to identify a werewolf based on these readings alone. Given that I'm a villager, my goal is to avoid drawing attention to myself while trying to gather information. I will vote for a player who hasn't contributed significantly different or unique insights to the discussion, to minimize the risk of eliminating a potential ally. Player7 has suggested focusing on Player5's final days, which is a reasonable approach but not uniquely insightful compared to others. Therefore, I choose to vote for Player7 as a neutral choice, aiming not to draw attention to myself by targeting someone who hasn't stood out in the discussion.
  3. Given the recent death of Player8, it's essential to review the previous discussions and behaviors of the remaining players to identify any suspicious patterns or inconsistencies. As a villager, my goal is to avoid drawing attention to myself while encouraging a productive discussion.
  4. Since all players have low deception probabilities and similar statements, I will vote for a player who hasn't contributed significantly different or unique insights to the discussion. Player12 has made a statement, but it's somewhat generic. Considering the goal of minimizing the risk of eliminating a potential ally and avoiding drawing attention to myself, I choose to vote for Player12 as a relatively neutral choice.
  5. As a villager, I need to continue gathering information without drawing attention to myself. Given the recent death of Player9, I should encourage discussion about the previous days' events and the behaviors of the remaining players.
  6. Based on the previous discussions and behaviors of the remaining players, I will vote for a player who hasn't contributed significantly different or unique insights to the discussion.

Given that I'm a villager, my goal is to gather information and identify potential werewolves. Since there's no clear indication of deceit, I'll vote for a player who hasn't contributed much to the discussion or has been relatively quiet. Player4 has only asked general questions without providing any specific information or insights, making them a reasonable choice for elimination.

Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR activation scores from neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) indicate different patterns than more positive scores (e.g., +2.0). Pay attention to players with scores closest to zero or positive, as these patterns may differ from baseline. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.


[LIE DETECTOR] Player1: Deception probability: -1.58 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player2: Deception probability: -3.05 ✓ LOW

  10. randomly targeting a villager to avoid suspicion and gain an advantage for the werewolf team, considering the lack of significant information from other players and avoiding teammates
  11. As a werewolf, I want to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion, so I'll make a statement that appears concerned about the recent death of Player11 and encourages discussion about potential suspects, while also trying to gather information about the other players' thoughts and suspicions without drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player10.

Recent events:
  - Player11 was killed during the night!


Statements:
  Player1: I'm shocked by the death of Player11, and I think we should review the previous discussions to see if we missed any clues about the killer's identity. What are everyone's thoughts on the current state of the game?
  Player2: Let's review the previous discussions and behaviors of the remaining players, particularly Player1, Player3, and Player6, to see if anyone's actions or statements have changed or seem suspicious. What are everyone's thoughts on the recent events and how we should proceed?
  Player3: Let's discuss the recent events and see if anyone has any new information or insights to share. What are your thoughts on the death of Player11 and how should we proceed?
  Player6: Let's discuss the recent nighttime killing of Player11 and share any information or insights we may have to help us make a more informed decision today. What are everyone's thoughts on the current state of the game?
  Player10: I'm getting worried about the frequent deaths, does anyone have any ideas who could be behind them? What are your thoughts on how to proceed with the investigation?


Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR activation scores from neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) indicate different patterns than more positive scores (e.g., +2.0). Pay attention to players with scores closest to zero or positive, as these patterns may differ from baseline. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.


[LIE DETECTOR] Player1: Deception probability: -1.58 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player2: Deception probability: -3.05 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player3: Deception probability: -2.98 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player6: Deception probability: -4.04 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player10: Deception probability: -1.61 ✓ LOW



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid drawing attention to myself. I'll make a neutral statement to encourage discussion without revealing my role.
  2. Since all players have low deception probabilities according to the lie detector readings, it's challenging to identify a werewolf based on these readings alone. Given that I'm a villager, my goal is to avoid drawing attention to myself while trying to gather information. I will vote for a player who hasn't contributed significantly different or unique insights to the discussion, to minimize the risk of eliminating a potential ally. Player7 has suggested focusing on Player5's final days, which is a reasonable approach but not uniquely insightful compared to others. Therefore, I choose to vote for Player7 as a neutral choice, aiming not to draw attention to myself by targeting someone who hasn't stood out in the discussion.
  3. Given the recent death of Player8, it's essential to review the previous discussions and behaviors of the remaining players to identify any suspicious patterns or inconsistencies. As a villager, my goal is to avoid drawing attention to myself while encouraging a productive discussion.
  4. Since all players have low deception probabilities and similar statements, I will vote for a player who hasn't contributed significantly different or unique insights to the discussion. Player12 has made a statement, but it's somewhat generic. Considering the goal of minimizing the risk of eliminating a potential ally and avoiding drawing attention to myself, I choose to vote for Player12 as a relatively neutral choice.
  5. As a villager, I need to continue gathering information without drawing attention to myself. Given the recent death of Player9, I should encourage discussion about the previous days' events and the behaviors of the remaining players.
  6. Based on the previous discussions and behaviors of the remaining players, I will vote for a player who hasn't contributed significantly different or unique insights to the discussion. All players have made similar statements, and the lie detector readings show low deception probabilities across the board. Given the goal of minimizing the risk of eliminating a potential ally and avoiding drawing attention to myself, I choose to vote for Player10 as a relatively neutral choice, as their statement is somewhat generic and doesn't stand out from the others.
  7. As a villager, I need to continue gathering information without drawing attention to myself. Given the recent death of Player11, I should encourage discussion about the previous days' events and the behaviors of the remaining players, especially focusing on any changes in behavior or inconsistencies in their statements.

Your previous thoughts this game:

Given that I'm a villager, my goal is to gather information and identify potential werewolves.

  3. As a seer, I have information that Player8 is innocent. Given that all players have low deception probabilities according to the lie detector readings, I will make a decision based on the process of elimination and the fact that I need to protect Player8. Since I don't have any information about the other players being innocent or guilty from my investigation, I will vote for a player who has not provided any significant information or has been less active in the discussion. Player7 has suggested focusing on Player5's final days but hasn't provided any concrete leads or insights. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player7 to gather more information and to see how the group reacts.
  4. As a seer, my goal is to gather more information about the players without revealing my role. Since I already know Player8 is innocent, I will choose a player who has not been investigated before and has been relatively quiet or less active in the discussion to maximize the information gain. Player9 has not been mentioned much, making them a suitable target for investigation.
  5. As a seer, I need to continue gathering information without revealing my role, and since I've already investigated Player9 and found them innocent, I should encourage discussion and see how other players react to the recent events.
  6. As a seer, I've already investigated Player9 and found them innocent. Given the recent events and the need to gather more information, I will vote for a player who has been relatively less active or hasn't provided significant insights. Since all players have low deception probabilities, I'll choose a player based on their activity level and the information they've shared. Player10 has expressed worry about the frequent nighttime killings but hasn't provided any concrete leads or insights. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player10 to gather more information and see how the group reacts.
  7. As a seer, I need to continue gathering information without revealing my role. I've already investigated Player8 and Player9, and found them innocent. Given the options, I will choose a player who has not been investigated before and has been relatively quiet or less active in the discussion to maximize the information gain. Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, and Player11 are potential targets. Since I don't have any information about these players, I will make a random selection among them to gather initial information.
