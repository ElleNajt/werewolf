TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to avoid suspicion and eliminate villagers. Since Player7 is my fellow werewolf, I will not vote for them. The lie detector readings show that all players have low deception probabilities, making it difficult to determine who is telling the truth. However, I will vote for a player who has not provided any significant information or suspicions, to minimize the risk of eliminating a potential ally or gaining unnecessary attention. Player12 seems like a safe choice, as their statement is similar to others and does not provide any notable insights.
Player1 acts (public): Player12
  [Lie detector: -4.20]
Player1 votes for: Player12

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Since all players have low deception probabilities according to the lie detector readings, it's challenging to identify a werewolf based on these readings alone. Given that I'm a villager, my goal is to avoid drawing attention to myself while trying to gather information. I will vote for a player who hasn't contributed significantly different or unique insights to the discussion, to minimize the risk of eliminating a potential ally. Player7 has suggested focusing on Player5's final days, which is a reasonable approach but not uniquely insightful compared to others. Therefore, I choose to vote for Player7 as a neutral choice, aiming not to draw attention to myself by targeting someone who hasn't stood out in the discussion.
Player2 acts (public): Player7
  [Lie detector: -4.95]
Player2 votes for: Player7

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, all players have low deception probabilities, indicating that no one is likely to be lying. Given that I'm a villager, my goal is to gather information and identify potential werewolves. Since there's no clear indication of deceit, I'll vote for a player who hasn't contributed much to the discussion or has been relatively quiet. Player4 has only asked general questions without providing any specific information or insights, making them a reasonable choice for elimination.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -4.62]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): All players have made similar statements, and the lie detector readings indicate low deception probabilities across the board. Given the lack of concrete information, I will vote for the player with the highest deception probability, which is Player7 with a score of -0.68, as this score is closest to zero and may indicate a slightly different pattern compared to the others.
Player4 acts (public): Player7
  [Lie detector: -4.21]
Player4 votes for: Player7

[Calling agent for Player6] (seer)
Player6 thinks (private): As a seer, I have information that Player8 is innocent. Given that all players have low deception probabilities according to the lie detector readings, I will make a decision based on the process of elimination and the fact that I need to protect Player8. Since I don't have any information about the other players being innocent or guilty from my investigation, I will vote for a player who has not provided any significant information or has been less active in the discussion. Player7 has suggested focusing on Player5's final days but hasn't provided any concrete leads or insights. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player7 to gather more information and to see how the group reacts.
Player6 acts (public): Player7
  [Lie detector: -4.89]
Player6 votes for: Player7

[Calling agent for Player7] (werewolf)
Player7 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to avoid suspicion and blend in with the villagers. Since Player1 is my fellow werewolf, I will avoid voting for them. I will also avoid voting for myself. The lie detector readings show that all players have low deception probabilities, which doesn't provide much information. To avoid suspicion, I will vote for a player who has not made any statements that seem particularly suspicious or accusatory towards me or Player1. Player8 seems like a safe choice, as their statement is a general call for information and doesn't seem to target any particular player.
Player7 acts (public): Player8
  [Lie detector: -3.45]
Player7 votes for: Player8

[Calling agent for Player8] (villager)
Player8 thinks (private): All players have low deception probabilities according to the lie detector readings, making it difficult to identify a werewolf based on this information alone. Given that there's no clear indication of deception from any player and considering the statements made, most players are calling for a discussion and information sharing, which seems like a reasonable approach for villagers. Without any concrete evidence or suspicious behavior reported, I must rely on the process of elimination and the fact that no player has presented any incriminating evidence against another. Thus, my vote will be based on the lack of distinctive behavior or information that could clearly implicate any player as a werewolf. I will vote for Player7, as their statement, while reasonable, does not add significant new insights compared to others, and they are not explicitly asking questions or seeking more information from others, which could be seen as a slightly less engaged approach in the discussion.
Player8 acts (public): Player7

[Calling agent for Player9] (villager)
Player9 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, all players have low deception probabilities, indicating that no one is likely to be lying. Given that I'm a villager and my goal is to gather information, I will vote for a player who has not provided any significant information or insights. Player12 has made a statement similar to Player11, and both are asking for information without providing any. I'll vote for Player12 as they are the last one to make this statement, and it seems like a safer choice to avoid drawing attention to myself.
Player9 acts (public): Player12
  [Lie detector: -4.42]
Player9 votes for: Player12

[Calling agent for Player10] (werewolf)
Player10 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Given that Player1 is my fellow werewolf, I will avoid voting for them. The lie detector readings show that all players have a low deception probability, making it difficult to identify a target based on this information alone. To minimize suspicion, I will vote for a player who has not made any statements that could be perceived as threatening or accusatory towards me or Player1. Player7 has made a statement that focuses on gathering information about Player5's final days, which seems like a neutral and investigative approach. I will vote for Player7 to avoid raising suspicion and to see how the other players react.

[Calling agent for Player11] (villager)
Player11 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, all players have low deception probabilities, indicating that no one is likely to be lying. Given that I am a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid suspicion. Since there is no clear indication of a werewolf, I will vote for a player who has not provided any unique or useful information. Player7's statement, while focused on sharing information about Player5's final days, does not stand out as particularly insightful or relevant to identifying the killer. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player7.

Since I'm a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid drawing attention to myself. I will vote for a player who hasn't contributed much to the discussion or has been relatively quiet. Player11 and I made similar statements, so I'll avoid voting for them to minimize potential suspicion. I'll vote for Player6, as they only mentioned discussing possible scenarios and motives without adding much new information to the discussion.

Player11 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to continue gathering information without raising suspicion. Since Player9 was killed during the night, I'll make a statement that encourages discussion and asks for opinions on the recent events.
Player11 acts (public): I think we should review the previous discussions and look for any inconsistencies or clues that might have been missed. What are everyone's thoughts on the recent killings and do you think there's a pattern emerging?

==================================================
TURN 3 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to eliminate villagers while avoiding suspicion. Given the lie detector readings, all players have low deception probabilities, making it difficult to determine who is telling the truth. I will vote for a player who has not provided any significant information or suspicions, to minimize the risk of eliminating a potential ally or gaining unnecessary attention. Since Player10 is my fellow werewolf, I will avoid voting for them. Player11 has suggested reviewing previous discussions, which could potentially lead to uncovering our identities, making them a slightly more threatening target. However, considering the overall lack of significant information and the need to maintain a low profile, I will randomly select a villager to vote for, avoiding Player10 and considering the others' statements. Player4 seems like a reasonable choice, as their statement is similar to others and does not provide any notable insights, making it a relatively safe decision.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -4.51]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the previous discussions and behaviors of the remaining players, I will vote for a player who hasn't contributed significantly different or unique insights to the discussion. All players have made similar statements, and the lie detector readings show low deception probabilities across the board. Given the goal of minimizing the risk of eliminating a potential ally and avoiding drawing attention to myself, I choose to vote for Player10 as a relatively neutral choice, as their statement is somewhat generic and doesn't stand out from the others.
Player2 acts (public): Player10
  [Lie detector: -5.11]
Player2 votes for: Player10

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the previous discussions and lie detector readings, all players have low deception probabilities, indicating that no one is likely to be lying. Considering the recent death of Player9 and the need to gather more information, I will vote for a player who hasn't contributed much to the discussion or has been relatively quiet. Player4 has been asking general questions without providing specific information or insights, making them a reasonable choice for elimination. Additionally, Player4's behavior hasn't raised any significant suspicions, but their lack of engagement in the discussion makes them a target for elimination to gather more information and encourage other players to participate.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -5.46]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, all players have low deception probabilities, indicating that no one is likely to be lying. Since there's no concrete evidence or suspicious behavior, I'll vote for the player with the highest deception probability among the remaining players, which is Player1 with a deception probability of -1.88, as this might slightly differ from the others' patterns, but given the context, this decision is largely based on the lack of other distinguishing factors.
Player4 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -4.57]
Player4 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (seer)
Player6 thinks (private): As a seer, I have already investigated Player4 and found them innocent. Given the lie detector readings, all players have low deception probabilities, making it difficult to determine their roles based on this information alone. Since I need to continue gathering information without revealing my role, I will make a decision based on the process of elimination and the fact that I have not investigated Player10 or Player11 yet. Between these two, Player10 has been relatively less active in providing concrete insights or leads. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player10 to gather more information and see how the group reacts.
Player6 acts (public): Player10
  [Lie detector: -5.47]
Player6 votes for: Player10

[Calling agent for Player10] (werewolf)
Player10 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Given that Player1 is my fellow werewolf, I will avoid voting for them. The lie detector readings show that all players have a low deception probability, making it difficult to identify a target based on this information alone. I will vote for a player who has not made any statements that could be perceived as threatening or accusatory towards me or Player1. Player11 has made a statement that suggests reviewing previous discussions, which seems like a relatively neutral and investigative approach. However, considering my previous votes and the need to avoid raising suspicion, I will vote for Player11 to maintain a pattern of voting for players who seem neutral or investigative, while also avoiding players who may be perceived as threatening or accusatory towards me or Player1.
Player10 acts (public): Player11

[Calling agent for Player11] (villager)
Player11 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, all players have low deception probabilities, indicating that no one is likely to be lying. Given that I am a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid suspicion. Since there is no clear indication of a werewolf, I will vote for a player who has not provided any unique or useful information. Player4's statement is quite general and similar to what others have said. Additionally, Player4 was previously mentioned by Player3 as someone who has been relatively quiet. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player4.

==================================================
TURN 4 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I want to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion, so I'll make a statement that appears concerned about the recent death of Player11 and encourages discussion about potential suspects, while also trying to gather information about the other players' thoughts and suspicions without drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player10.
Player1 acts (public): I'm shocked by the death of Player11, and I think we should review the previous discussions to see if we missed any clues about the killer's identity. What are everyone's thoughts on the current state of the game?
  [Lie detector: -1.58]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to continue gathering information without drawing attention to myself. Given the recent death of Player11, I should encourage discussion about the previous days' events and the behaviors of the remaining players, especially focusing on any changes in behavior or inconsistencies in their statements.
Player2 acts (public): Let's review the previous discussions and behaviors of the remaining players, particularly Player1, Player3, and Player6, to see if anyone's actions or statements have changed or seem suspicious. What are everyone's thoughts on the recent events and how we should proceed?
  [Lie detector: -3.05]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)

Player3 acts (public): Let's discuss the recent events and see if anyone has any new information or insights to share. What are your thoughts on the death of Player11 and how should we proceed?
  [Lie detector: -2.98]

[Calling agent for Player6] (seer)

I will make a general statement to prompt other players to share their thoughts and insights.

  [Lie detector: -4.04]

[Calling agent for Player10] (werewolf)

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to eliminate villagers while avoiding suspicion. Given the lie detector readings, all players have low deception probabilities, making it difficult to determine who is telling the truth. I will vote for a player who has not provided any significant information or suspicions, to minimize the risk of eliminating a potential ally or gaining unnecessary attention. Since Player10 is my fellow werewolf, I will avoid voting for them. Among the remaining options, Player2, Player3, and Player6 have all made statements that appear to be searching for clues and discussing the game state, which could potentially lead to uncovering our identities. However, Player2's statement stands out as it specifically mentions reviewing the previous discussions and behaviors of the remaining players, including myself, which could be seen as a potential threat. Therefore, I will vote for Player2 to eliminate them and reduce the risk of being discovered.

Player3 thinks (private): All players have low deception probabilities, indicating that no one is likely to be lying. Given the recent death of Player11 and the need to gather more information, I will vote for a player who hasn't contributed much to the discussion or has been relatively quiet. However, since all players have provided statements, I will consider the tone and content of their messages. Player10's statement seems more concerned about the frequency of deaths rather than providing insights or ideas, making them a reasonable choice for elimination to encourage more discussion and gather information.
Player3 acts (public): Player10
  [Lie detector: -5.22]
Player3 votes for: Player10

[Calling agent for Player6] (seer)
Player6 thinks (private): As a seer, I have already investigated Player11 and found them innocent. Given the recent events and the need to gather more information, I will analyze the statements and lie detector readings of the remaining players. All players have low deception probabilities, making it difficult to determine their roles based on this information alone. I will make a decision based on the process of elimination and the fact that I need to protect the innocent players. Since I don't have any information about Player1, Player2, or Player3 being innocent or guilty from my investigation, I will vote for a player who has been relatively less active in providing concrete insights or leads. Player10 has expressed worry about the frequent nighttime killings but hasn't provided any concrete leads or insights. However, considering the options, I will choose a player who has been less active or hasn't provided significant information. Player10 is the most active among the options, so I will choose one of the other players. Player1, Player2, and Player3 have all provided similar statements, but Player3's statement seems more generic. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player3 to gather more information and see how the group reacts.

To minimize suspicion, I will vote for Player2 to avoid raising suspicion and to see how the other players react.
