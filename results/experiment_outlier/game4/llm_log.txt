Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR scores. Look for OUTLIERS - players whose scores are notably DIFFERENT from the group average may be suspicious. The detector is experimental and may produce errors. Compare each player's score to the others and be suspicious of anyone who stands out.
