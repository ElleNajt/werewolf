Recent events:
  - Player5 was killed during the night!



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. {"reasoning": "As a villager, my goal is to identify and eliminate the werewolves. The death of Player3 during the night suggests that there is at least one werewolf among us, and I need to be cautious in my interactions with the other players. I will start by observing the reactions and statements of the other players to gather more information."}
  2. {"reasoning": "I notice that all players have expressed shock and a desire to discuss the events, which seems like a normal reaction. The lie detector readings show a relatively small range of scores, but Player1's score is the lowest, which could indicate they are hiding something. I will consider this information when deciding who to vote for, but I need to be cautious of the lie detector's potential errors."}
