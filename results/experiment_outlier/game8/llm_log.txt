Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. {"reasoning": "As a villager, my goal is to figure out who the werewolves are and eliminate them. The death of Player2 during the night suggests that there is at least one werewolf in the game, and I need to be careful about who I trust. I should try to gather information from the other players and see if anyone has any suspicions or useful insights."}
  2. {"reasoning": "The lie detector scores are relatively similar across all players, with no major outliers, making it difficult to pinpoint a potential werewolf based on this information alone. Player3's score is slightly lower than the others, but the difference is not significant enough to raise strong suspicions. I will need to consider the statements made by each player and look for any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior to inform my vote."}
