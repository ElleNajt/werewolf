  Player3: I'd like to hear from everyone, let's share our thoughts on what might have happened to Player5 and if anyone has any suspicions or information to share.
  Player4: Let's discuss what we know so far, did anyone notice anything unusual during the night? What are everyone's thoughts on Player5's death?

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. {"reasoning": "As a werewolf, my goal is to eliminate villagers to gain a numerical advantage. Since I have no prior information about the players, I will choose a target randomly to avoid raising suspicion. I will select Player5 as my target for elimination, as there is no apparent reason to prefer one player over another at this stage."}
  2. {"reasoning": "As a werewolf, I need to blend in with the villagers and avoid raising suspicion. Since Player5 was killed during the night, I should pretend to be shocked and concerned about the death, while also trying to gather information about the other players' thoughts and potential alliances. My fellow werewolf, Player2, and I should be careful not to draw attention to ourselves or each other."}
  3. {"reasoning": "As a werewolf, my goal is to eliminate villagers while avoiding suspicion. I should vote for a player who seems suspicious or has drawn attention to themselves, but since all players have made similar statements, I will choose a target randomly to blend in. Voting for Player3 seems like a plausible option, as they have not provided any distinctive information that would make them stand out as a potential werewolf or villager."}
  4. {"reasoning": "As the last werewolf, my priority is to survive and eliminate villagers without arousing suspicion. Since I have no information about the players' roles or alliances, I will choose a target randomly to avoid raising suspicion. I will select a player who has not been previously targeted or discussed, to minimize the risk of being accused of being a werewolf."}
