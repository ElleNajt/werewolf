==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, I notice that Player2 and Player4 have high suspicion scores, which could indicate they might be werewolves.

I will ask a question to gather more information and see how other players react.

==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, I've identified Player4 as the most suspicious player, with a cumulative suspicion score of -204.5.
