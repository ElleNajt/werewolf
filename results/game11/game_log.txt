==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I will vote for Player11 because they have the most negative lie detector score, which could indicate they are trying to hide something. Additionally, voting for a player who is not my fellow werewolf (Player5) will help me avoid suspicion. By eliminating a player with a negative score, I can pretend to be helping the group while also protecting myself and my fellow werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): Player11
  [Lie detector: -2.92]
Player1 votes for: Player11

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, Player1 and Player12 have the least negative scores, which could indicate they are telling the truth. However, since the detector is experimental and may produce errors, it's crucial to consider the statements made by all players. Most players are calling for discussion and information sharing, which seems like a reasonable approach. Given that I'm a villager and my goal is to gather information and avoid suspicion, I will vote for the player with the most negative lie detector score, as this might indicate deception. Player11 has the most negative score of -3.58, which could suggest they are hiding something.
Player2 acts (public): Player11
  [Lie detector: -4.15]
Player2 votes for: Player11

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, Player1 and Player12 have scores closest to zero, which may indicate they are telling the truth. However, since the detector is experimental and may produce errors, it's crucial to consider the statements made by all players. Most players are calling for discussion and information sharing, which seems like a reasonable approach at this stage. Given that I'm a villager, my goal is to avoid drawing attention to myself while trying to gather information. Voting for a player with a very negative lie detector score might be a good strategy, but it's also important to consider the statements made. Player11 has the most negative lie detector score and also made a fairly generic statement, which doesn't particularly stand out as helpful or suspicious. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player11, as their score and statement don't provide strong reasons to keep them at this point.
Player3 acts (public): Player11
  [Lie detector: -4.16]
Player3 votes for: Player11

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, I notice that Player1 and Player12 have scores closest to zero (-0.97 and -1.00 respectively), which may indicate they are telling the truth. However, since the detector is experimental and may produce errors, I will not rely solely on these readings. Considering the statements made by all players, they all seem to be encouraging discussion and gathering information, which is a typical villager behavior. Given the lack of concrete evidence, I will vote for the player with the most neutral statement, which is not necessarily an indication of guilt, but rather a lack of information to make a more informed decision. Player12's statement seems to be focusing on gathering more information before making accusations, which aligns with my own goal as a villager.
Player4 acts (public): Player12
  [Lie detector: -4.28]
Player4 votes for: Player12

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. I will vote for a player with a low lie detector score to avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf. Player11 has the lowest lie detector score, making them a safe target. Voting for Player11 will also help to distract the villagers from our true identities.
Player5 acts (public): Player11
  [Lie detector: -3.29]
Player5 votes for: Player11

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, Player1 and Player12 have scores closest to zero (-0.97 and -1.00 respectively), which may indicate they are telling the truth. However, it's crucial to consider the experimental nature of the lie detector and potential errors. Given the lack of concrete evidence, I will vote for the player with the most extreme lie detector reading, as this might suggest a higher likelihood of deception. Player11 has the most negative score (-3.58), which could imply a different pattern than the others, but without more information, this is a tentative conclusion at best. Therefore, my vote is based on the process of elimination and the available data, albeit with caution due to the detector's potential for errors.
Player6 acts (public): Player11
  [Lie detector: -4.24]
Player6 votes for: Player11

[Calling agent for Player7] (villager)
Player7 thinks (private): Analyzing the statements and lie detector readings, most players have made similar statements calling for discussion and information sharing. The lie detector readings are mostly negative, but Player1 and Player12 have scores closest to zero (-0.97 and -1.00 respectively), which might indicate they are being more truthful or have less to hide. However, with no clear indication of deceit or strong evidence against any player, the decision is difficult. Given the lack of concrete information, I will vote for the player with the most negative lie detector score, which is Player11 with a score of -3.58, as this could potentially indicate a higher level of stress or deception, but it's essential to note that the lie detector is experimental and may produce errors.

[Calling agent for Player9] (villager)
Player9 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, Player1 and Player12 have scores closest to zero (-0.97 and -1.00 respectively), which may indicate they are telling the truth. However, since the detector is experimental and may produce errors, it's crucial to consider the statements made by all players. Most players are asking for information and encouraging discussion, which seems like a reasonable approach at this stage. Given that there's no clear indication of deceit from any player, and considering the goal of gathering information without drawing attention, I will vote for the player with the most extreme lie detector reading, as this might indicate a potential werewolf trying to deflect attention or create confusion.
Player9 acts (public): Player11
  [Lie detector: -4.12]
Player9 votes for: Player11

[Calling agent for Player10] (villager)
Player10 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, I will vote for the player with the most negative score, which could indicate a potential werewolf. However, since all scores are negative, I'll consider other factors such as statements and behavior. Players 1, 5, and 12 have relatively less negative scores, which might suggest they are villagers. I'll avoid voting for them. Player11 has the most negative score, but I'll also consider the fact that the lie detector may be faulty. Given the information, I'll vote for Player11 as they have the most negative score, but I'm aware that this decision is not conclusive.

Player10 votes for: Player11

[Calling agent for Player11] (villager)
Player11 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, Player1 and Player12 have the scores closest to zero (-0.97 and -1.00 respectively), which may indicate they are telling the truth. However, since the lie detector is experimental and may produce errors, I will not rely solely on these readings. Considering the statements made by all players, most of them are calling for discussion and information sharing, which seems like a reasonable approach at this stage. Given that I don't have any concrete evidence or strong suspicions against any particular player, I will vote for the player with the least distinctive or contributing statement, or one that seems somewhat generic or less engaged. Player5's statement seems somewhat generic and cautious, but not particularly distinctive or contributing new ideas to the discussion. However, given the context and the need for a decision, I will choose a player based on the least engagement or contribution to the discussion, which in this initial phase, is somewhat subjective. I will vote for Player5 due to the cautious and somewhat generic nature of their statement, which doesn't particularly stand out or contribute new insights compared to others.

[Calling agent for Player12] (werewolf)
Player12 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to avoid drawing attention to myself and my fellow werewolf, Player1. The lie detector readings show that Player1 and I have scores closest to zero, which could indicate that we are hiding something. However, I will not vote for Player1 as that would be suspicious. Instead, I will vote for a player with a low lie detector score, but not the lowest, to avoid raising suspicion. Player11 has the lowest score, but voting for them might seem too obvious. I will vote for Player2, who has a relatively low score and has not said anything particularly suspicious or revealing.

Player6 thinks (private): Given the recent killing of Player7, it's essential to discuss and gather information. The lie detector readings, although not entirely reliable, suggest that Player1 and Player12 might be truthful, but without concrete evidence, it's crucial to consider all possibilities and encourage discussion to identify potential suspects.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should share any information we have and discuss the lie detector readings to see if we can find any patterns or clues that might lead us to the werewolf, and I'd like to hear from Player1 and Player12 regarding their thoughts on the current situation.

Additionally, Player6 has asked for my thoughts on the current situation, which might be an attempt to gauge my reactions.

Player6 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings and the discussion, I will vote for the player with the most negative score, which could indicate a different pattern than the others. However, since my own score is also very negative (-3.79), I should avoid drawing attention to the scores alone. Considering the statements and the need to gather more information, I will vote for a player who has not contributed significantly to the discussion or has raised some suspicion.

Player1 thinks (private): Considering the lie detector scores, Player2, Player3, and Player4 have the most negative scores, which could indicate they are trying to hide something. However, as a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Voting for a player with a very negative score could be seen as a genuine attempt to eliminate a suspicious player. On the other hand, Player5 is my fellow werewolf, so I must avoid voting for them. Players 10 and 12 have relatively less negative scores, but voting for them could still be seen as a random attempt to gather information. Given the options, I will vote for Player2, as they have a very negative lie detector score and are not my fellow werewolf.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, I will vote for the player with the most negative score, which could indicate deception. Among the options, Player3 has the most negative score of -3.47, followed closely by Player4 with a score of -3.45. However, since Player3 has the most negative score among the available options, I will vote to eliminate Player3.

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, Player1, Player5, and Player12 have scores closest to zero, which may indicate they are telling the truth. However, since the detector is experimental and may produce errors, it's crucial to consider the statements made by all players. Most players are calling for discussion and information sharing, which seems like a reasonable approach at this stage. Given that I'm a villager, my goal is to avoid drawing attention to myself while trying to gather information. Voting for a player with a very negative lie detector score might be a good strategy, but it's also important to consider the statements made. Among the options, Player2 has the most negative lie detector score (-3.44), but they are not an option for voting. The next most negative score is Player10 (-2.90) and Player4 (-3.45), but Player4's score is more negative. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player4, as their score is the most negative among the options and their statement doesn't provide strong reasons to keep them at this point.

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings and the statements made by all players, I notice that most players have negative scores and are encouraging discussion and gathering information. Since the detector is experimental and may produce errors, I will not rely solely on these readings. Considering the statements made, they all seem to be typical villager behavior. Given the lack of concrete evidence, I will vote for the player with the most negative lie detector score among the options, which is not available. Instead, I will choose the player with the score that is most distinct from the others. Player1 has a score of -1.70, which is closer to zero compared to the other options. However, this is not a strong indication of guilt or innocence. Among the other options, Player5 has a score of -1.75, which is also relatively closer to zero. Player12 has a score of -1.74, similar to Player1 and Player5. Between these, I will choose Player2, as their statement seems to be more focused on discussing potential leads or suspicions, but their lie detector score is -3.44, which is more negative than the others, excluding Player3. However, considering that I need to make a decision based on the information provided, and given that all players seem to be acting like villagers, I will choose the player that seems to be less engaged in the discussion or has a statement that could be seen as slightly more generic or less contributory to the investigation.

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Given the lie detector scores, I notice that Player1, Player5, and Player12 have scores closest to zero or least negative. Since Player1 is my fellow werewolf and I am Player5, I should avoid drawing attention to ourselves. Therefore, I will vote for a player with a low lie detector score, but not the lowest, to avoid raising suspicion. Player2, Player3, and Player4 have the lowest scores, making them potential targets. Among these, I will randomly select one to maintain the appearance of a villager trying to make an informed decision without revealing my true identity or intentions.

[Calling agent for Player10] (villager)
Player10 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, I notice that Player2, Player3, and Player4 have the most negative scores, which could indicate potential werewolves. However, considering the experimental nature of the lie detector and the possibility of errors, I will also take into account the statements made by players. Players 1, 5, and 12 have relatively less negative scores and have made statements that seem to encourage discussion and gathering of information, which might suggest they are villagers. Given the information available, I will vote for Player2 as they have a very negative lie detector score (-3.44) and their statement seems to be focused on discussing potential leads and suspicions without revealing much about themselves.

[Calling agent for Player12] (werewolf)
Player12 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I want to avoid drawing attention to myself and my fellow werewolf, Player1. The lie detector readings show that Player1 and I have scores closest to zero, which could indicate that we are hiding something. However, I will not vote for Player1 as that would be suspicious. Instead, I will vote for a player with a low lie detector score, but not the lowest, to avoid raising suspicion. Player2 has a relatively low score and has not said anything particularly suspicious or revealing, making them a suitable target.
