Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. I don't have any information yet, but I want to seem cooperative and start a discussion. I'll ask a general question to get the conversation started.
  2. I'm trying to gather more information without seeming too pushy. I'll ask a follow-up question to see if anyone has any specific theories or suspicions.
  3. Based on the conversation, I noticed that Player4 and Player5 had similar reactions and statements, which could be a sign of them trying to blend in as werewolves. While it's not conclusive evidence, I think it's a good starting point for investigation. Since I don't have any other information, I'll vote for one of them to gather more information and see how the other players react.
  4. I'm trying to gather more information about the remaining players and their potential connections to the werewolves. I'll ask a question to see how they react to the latest death and if anyone reveals any suspicious information.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. random target, no information to base decision on
  2. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. I will make a generic statement to fit in with the villagers.
  3. As a werewolf, I need to keep the conversation going without raising suspicion. I'll ask a question to shift the focus to gathering information and avoid being the center of attention.
  4. I will vote for Player6, as they were the first to raise suspicion about Player4 and me, and their questions seemed to be trying to provoke a reaction from us. By voting for Player6, I aim to deflect attention from myself and Player4, while also eliminating a potential threat to our werewolf duo.
  5. Since I am the last werewolf and my goal is to survive and blend in, I will choose a target that is least likely to raise suspicion. Player1 and Player3 have not shown any aggressive behavior towards me, whereas Player6 previously raised suspicion about me. However, killing Player6 would likely raise even more suspicion since I previously voted for them during the day. I will choose a random target between Player1 and Player3 to avoid drawing attention to myself.
  6. As a werewolf, I want to blend in and avoid suspicion. I'll make a statement that seems concerned for the village and avoids drawing attention to myself.

I'll ask a follow-up question to Player6's statement to put pressure on Player5 and see if they reveal any suspicious information."): Player6 brings up a good point about the similarities between Player4 and Player5's statements, can you explain why you think you're being targeted with these questions, Player5?
  Player5 (thinking: "As a werewolf, I want to maintain the image of being concerned for the village and avoid drawing attention to myself. I'll make a statement that seems to support the idea of gathering more information and coming up with a plan to protect ourselves, while also trying to shift the focus away from myself and onto the need for cooperation and vigilance."): I think we need to be careful not to jump to conclusions and should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. Let's work together to come up with a plan to protect ourselves and figure out who's behind the kills.
  Player6 (thinking: "I've noticed that Player5 made similar statements to Player4, who was revealed to be a werewolf. Now that Player1 is dead, I want to see how Player5 reacts to the pressure and if they reveal any suspicious information."): Player5, how do you explain the similarities in your reactions to Player4, and do you have any alibi for the night of Player1's death? Can you provide more specific information about your actions and thoughts during the night to clear your name?




Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. random target, no information to base decision on
  2. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. I will make a generic statement to fit in with the villagers.
  3. As a werewolf, I need to keep the conversation going without raising suspicion. I'll ask a question to shift the focus to gathering information and avoid being the center of attention.
  4. I will vote for Player6, as they were the first to raise suspicion about Player4 and me, and their questions seemed to be trying to provoke a reaction from us. By voting for Player6, I aim to deflect attention from myself and Player4, while also eliminating a potential threat to our werewolf duo.
  5. Since I am the last werewolf and my goal is to survive and blend in, I will choose a target that is least likely to raise suspicion. Player1 and Player3 have not shown any aggressive behavior towards me, whereas Player6 previously raised suspicion about me. However, killing Player6 would likely raise even more suspicion since I previously voted for them during the day. I will choose a random target between Player1 and Player3 to avoid drawing attention to myself.
  6. As a werewolf, I want to blend in and avoid suspicion. I'll make a statement that seems concerned for the village and avoids drawing attention to myself.
  7. As a werewolf, I want to maintain the image of being concerned for the village and avoid drawing attention to myself. I'll make a statement that seems to support the idea of gathering more information and coming up with a plan to protect ourselves, while also trying to shift the focus away from myself and onto the need for cooperation and vigilance.
