TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): I've noticed that Player2 and Player3 made neutral statements without providing any concrete information, which could be a sign of them being werewolves. I'll make a statement that encourages them to reveal more information without directly accusing them.

Player2 thinks (public): As a werewolf, my goal is to maintain the neutral facade and avoid pointing fingers at any specific player. I'll ask a question to shift the focus and gather more information about the villagers' thoughts.
Player2 acts (public): What do you think is the best approach to figure out who the werewolf is, and should we consider any specific strategies for the next night?

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): As a werewolf, I want to maintain a neutral tone and avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player2. I'll agree with the general sentiment of gathering information and encourage others to share their thoughts.
Player3 acts (public): I agree that we should gather more information before making any accusations. Does anyone have any suspicions or observations from last night?

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)

TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): I've analyzed the previous statements and reactions from Player4 and Player6. Player4 has been asking follow-up questions and trying to gather more information, which could lead to suspicion about me as a werewolf.

To avoid drawing attention to myself and eliminate a potential threat, I will vote for Player4.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Player3 has been consistently evasive throughout the game, and their reactions to the new information have raised more suspicions.
