  [Lie detector: -68.35]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): I need to protect my fellow werewolf and eliminate a villager. Voting for Player3 will also create confusion and make it seem like I'm voting based on suspicion rankings rather than my true alignment.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -69.64]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I'm voting for Player6. Player6 has a high suspicion score and has been trying to shift the attention to other players, including me. Additionally, Player6's statement seemed evasive and uncooperative. Given the available information, I believe Player6 is more likely to be a werewolf than the other options.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.91]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player6 have high suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. Since Player6 has a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score, I will vote to eliminate Player6 to minimize the risk of a werewolf remaining in the game.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.94]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player6 have high suspicion scores, indicating a greater likelihood of deception. Although Player3 is at the top of the suspicion rankings, their score is relatively low, suggesting they might be innocent. Considering the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player6, it's reasonable to vote for one of them. Between the two, Player6 has a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score and has made statements that seem evasive and suspicious. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player6.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -71.15]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): As a werewolf, my goal is to eliminate a villager while avoiding suspicion. Since Player1 is my fellow werewolf, I must protect them. The cumulative suspicion rankings show that Player3, Player4, and Player5 have relatively low suspicion scores, but Player3 is at the top. Voting for Player3 would be a safe choice, as it would eliminate a villager and avoid drawing attention to myself or Player1.
Player6 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -70.56]
Player6 votes for: Player3

Vote results: {'Player3': 2, 'Player6': 3}
Player6 is eliminated with 3 votes!

  [Lie detector: -66.70]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Given the new information that Player3 was killed, I need to analyze the remaining players and their previous statements. I should focus on the players with high suspicion scores and try to gather more information about their actions and intentions.
Player4 acts (public): Considering Player1's high suspicion score and previous evasive statements, can you explain your actions and intentions in more detail? What do you think about Player3's death and do you have any suspicions about the remaining players?

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)

==================================================

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player4 has a lower score than Player5, but not significantly. Considering the recent statements, Player5 has been actively questioning me and putting pressure on me to explain my actions.

Additionally, Player4's statements have been more focused on gathering information and less accusatory towards me, making them a less immediate threat.
