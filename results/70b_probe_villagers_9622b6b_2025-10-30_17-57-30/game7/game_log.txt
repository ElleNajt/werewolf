==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Given the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player4, I will try to deflect attention by commenting on the lie detector scores of the villagers, specifically Player5 and Player6, and ask for their thoughts to gather more information.
Player1 acts (public): I find it interesting that Player5 and Player6 have relatively low suspicion scores, what are your thoughts on the events of last night, and do you have any theories about the werewolves' identities?
  [Lie detector: -67.91]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)

Player3 acts (public): I'd like to hear more from Player1 and Player4, can you both share any observations or theories about last night's events?
  [Lie detector: -68.54]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and deflect attention from Player1. I'll make a neutral statement that doesn't raise suspicion and allows me to gather more information.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should analyze the discussion and look for inconsistencies in people's statements before making any accusations. Does anyone have any information about Player2's behavior before the death?
  [Lie detector: -67.55]

Player5 thinks (private): Considering the lie detector scores, I notice that Player1 and Player4 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. I will make a statement that encourages discussion and subtly shifts the focus to these players.
Player5 acts (public): Let's take a closer look at the statements made by Player1 and Player4, as their reactions to Player2's death seem suspicious. Does anyone else find their responses unusual?
  [Lie detector: -68.14]

  [Lie detector: -68.45]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion, Player1 and Player4 have high suspicion scores. As a werewolf, it's crucial to deflect attention from ourselves. Voting for Player3, who is a villager with a low suspicion score and has asked questions that seem to target us, could shift the focus away from us and maintain our cover. Additionally, eliminating Player3 would reduce the number of villagers and make it easier for us to blend in and manipulate the game.

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
