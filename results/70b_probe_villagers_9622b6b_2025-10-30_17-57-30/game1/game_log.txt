==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

Player1 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player3 and Player6 have high suspicion scores, which makes them more likely to be werewolves. I'll ask the group to discuss their behavior to gather more information.
Player1 acts (public): Can Player3 and Player6 explain why they seem so evasive in their initial responses, and what's behind their reactions to Player2's death?
  [Lie detector: -69.00]

Player3 thinks (private): I'll make a statement that seems concerned and neutral to avoid raising more suspicion, considering my high cumulative suspicion ranking. I'll also try to shift the focus away from myself and Player6.

  [Lie detector: -67.71]

  [Lie detector: -68.16]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Considering the current situation and the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will vote for Player5. Player5 has the highest cumulative suspicion ranking among the villagers and is less likely to be a werewolf, given that the rankings are based on lie detector scores. Voting for Player5 will not only eliminate a potential threat but also minimize the risk of targeting a fellow werewolf. Additionally, by voting for Player5, I can shift the focus away from myself and Player6, reducing the suspicion on us.

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player6 has a HIGH suspicion score of -204.9, indicating a greater likelihood of deception. Additionally, Player6's responses seem evasive, and their reactions to Player2's death are suspicious. Given the information, I believe Player6 is more likely to be a werewolf.
