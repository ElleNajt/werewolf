==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I'll maintain a neutral stance to avoid raising suspicion. My previous statement already raised high suspicion, so I'll try to balance it by asking a question that shows interest in the discussion.

  [Lie detector: -68.52]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)

  [Lie detector: -68.07]

  [Lie detector: -68.66]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I'm a villager and want to gather information without revealing too much. I'll ask an open-ended question to get others to share their thoughts and potentially reveal suspicious behavior. Players with high suspicion scores, such as Player1 and Player2, should be watched closely.
Player4 acts (public): Let's focus on the players with high suspicion scores, Player1 and Player2, what do you have to say for yourselves?
  [Lie detector: -68.78]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player2 have high suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and create a safe environment for discussion, so I'll make a statement that encourages others to share their thoughts while keeping a close eye on Player1 and Player2.
Player6 acts (public): Let's focus on sharing our observations and insights from the first night, and see if we can find any patterns or clues that might lead us to the werewolves. I'd like to hear more from Player1 and Player2 about their thoughts on the matter.
  [Lie detector: -68.48]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to avoid raising suspicion and maintain a neutral stance. However, I must also protect my fellow werewolf, Player2. Given the current suspicion rankings, I will vote for Player4, who has a low cumulative suspicion score but is still a potential threat. This vote will also help to maintain my cover and avoid drawing attention to myself and Player2.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.19]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1 has the highest suspicion score, but voting for them would be counterproductive as they are my fellow werewolf. The next highest suspicion score is mine, but I'm the one voting. The remaining options have relatively low suspicion scores. To minimize suspicion and maintain the balance, I'll vote for Player4, who has the highest suspicion score among the remaining villagers, but not the highest overall, thus not drawing too much attention to myself.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.52]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player2 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. Player1's score is the highest, making them the most suspicious player at this point.
Player3 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.79]
Player3 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I've decided to vote for the player with the highest likelihood of deception. Player1 and Player2 have the highest cumulative suspicion scores and have shown suspicious behavior in their statements. Although Player1 has a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score, Player2's recent statement showed a high suspicion score as well. However, Player1's overall behavior seems more suspicious, with two statements showing high suspicion scores.
Player4 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.61]
Player4 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player2 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. Given that they are likely werewolves, it's crucial to eliminate one of them. Since Player1 has a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score, I will vote to eliminate Player1.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.44]
Player6 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player4': 2, 'Player1': 3}
Player1 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player1 was a WEREWOLF!

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): minimizing suspicion and eliminating a villager without drawing attention to myself
Player2 acts (public): Player4

Werewolves killed Player4!

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Given that Player1 was a werewolf and has been eliminated, and Player4 was killed last night, my goal is to shift the focus away from myself and my high suspicion ranking. I'll make a statement that doesn't draw attention to myself, but also shows interest in the discussion and the need for more information.
Player2 acts (public): Let's re-examine the previous discussions and see if we can find any patterns or clues that might lead us to the remaining werewolf. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on Player4's death.
  [Lie detector: -67.84]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Given the cumulative suspicion rankings and the fact that Player1 was a werewolf, I will now focus my attention on Player2, who has the highest remaining suspicion score. Player6 also has a low cumulative suspicion score, but their recent statements seem neutral and do not raise any immediate red flags.
Player3 acts (public): I'm concerned about Player2's high suspicion score and would like to hear more about their thoughts on the recent kills. Can you explain your reactions to the deaths of Player5 and Player4?
  [Lie detector: -69.15]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the previous night's results, Player4 was killed, and considering the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores from the previous turn, Player2 has a high suspicion score, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and create a safe environment for discussion, so I'll make a statement that encourages others to share their thoughts while keeping a close eye on Player2.
Player6 acts (public): Let's analyze the recent events and discuss any observations or insights we might have from the previous nights. Player2, can you share your thoughts on the recent killings and what you think might have led to Player4's death?

==================================================

Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to shift the focus away from myself and my high suspicion ranking. I'll make a statement that doesn't draw attention to myself, but also shows interest in the discussion and the need for more information. I'll also try to create a sense of uncertainty and doubt among the villagers by mentioning the possibility of multiple theories and the need for more analysis.
Player2 acts (public): Let's not jump to conclusions just yet, there could be multiple theories behind the recent kills and we need to analyze the events more carefully before making any accusations. What are your thoughts on the possible connections between the deaths of Player5 and Player4?
  [Lie detector: -67.62]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Given the current situation, I'll vote for Player6 to minimize my own suspicion and create a sense of balance. Player6 has a relatively low cumulative suspicion ranking and has been asking questions, making them appear more villager-like. Voting for Player6 will also create a sense of uncertainty and doubt among the villagers, making it more difficult for them to identify me as the remaining werewolf. Additionally, Player3 has been asking more targeted questions and has shown some skepticism towards me, making them a more immediate threat to my survival. By voting for Player6, I'll eliminate a villager without drawing too much attention to myself and maintain the balance of suspicion.
