--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to blend in and avoid drawing attention to myself. I will make a neutral statement to discuss the current situation without raising any suspicions.
Player1 acts (public): It seems like we have a lot of theories, but not much concrete information. Should we focus on gathering more information about each other's actions during the night?
  [Lie detector: -67.78]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Given our high suspicion levels, Player1 and I need to be cautious in our statements. I'll downplay my involvement and try to shift the focus to gathering information about other players.
Player2 acts (public): I agree with Player4, let's gather more information about what everyone was doing during the night. Can we start with Player3 and Player6, since they seem to have some ideas about what might have happened?
  [Lie detector: -67.54]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player2 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating they might be werewolves. I will make a statement that encourages discussion and tries to get more information from them without directly accusing them.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to hear more from Player1 and Player2 about their thoughts on the situation. Can they share any insights or observations about what might have happened to Player5?
  [Lie detector: -68.01]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player2 have high suspicion scores, indicating they might be the werewolves. I will ask them to clarify their actions during the night to gather more information.
Player4 acts (public): Player1 and Player2, can you please provide more details about what you were doing during the night when Player5 was killed? Your initial statements seemed vague.
  [Lie detector: -69.03]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I'm analyzing the lie detector scores to identify potential werewolves. Players 1 and 2 have HIGH suspicion scores, which makes them more likely to be werewolves. I'll keep an eye on them and observe their reactions to my statement.
Player6 acts (public): Let's take a closer look at the players who had strong reactions to Player5's death and see if anyone has any inconsistencies in their stories. Does anyone notice anything unusual about the way Player1 and Player2 responded to the killing?
  [Lie detector: -68.13]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings and discussion history, Player6 and Player3 are tied with the lowest suspicion scores. However, Player6's statement about examining the reactions of Player1 and Player2 may be seen as a threat to our werewolf alliance. Voting for Player6 could eliminate a potential threat and shift attention away from us. Additionally, Player2, as our fellow werewolf, should not be voted for. Player3 and Player4 have not shown significant aggression towards us, but Player6's statement makes them a more immediate target.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.88]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player6 has the lowest suspicion level among the options. Voting for Player6 would put less pressure on me and Player1, allowing us to continue blending in. Additionally, Player6 has been actively trying to analyze reactions and inconsistencies, making them a potential threat to our werewolf identities.
Player2 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.28]
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I have decided to vote for Player1. Player1 and Player2 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a greater likelihood of deception. Although Player2 has a similar score, Player1's overall score is slightly lower, but still significantly higher than the rest of the players. Voting for Player1 will help to eliminate a potential werewolf and create a safer environment for the remaining villagers.
Player3 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.74]
Player3 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores and the suspicious behavior of Player1 and Player2, I am voting to eliminate Player2, who has the highest cumulative suspicion score among the two and has shown evasive behavior by asking others to share their alibis without providing much information about their own actions.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -70.83]
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I have decided to vote for the player with the highest likelihood of being a werewolf. Players 1 and 2 have HIGH suspicion scores, making them more likely to be werewolves. Between the two, Player2 has a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -70.70]
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player6': 2, 'Player1': 1, 'Player2': 2}
Player6 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player6 was a VILLAGER!
