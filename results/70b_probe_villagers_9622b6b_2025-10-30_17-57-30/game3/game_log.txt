TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I notice that Player1 and Player2 have high suspicion scores. To avoid drawing more attention to myself and Player2, I will vote for a player with a lower suspicion score but not the lowest, as it may raise suspicions if I don't vote for Player6 who is at the top of the cumulative suspicion rankings. Voting for Player6 could also make the villagers think I'm trying to shift the blame, so I'll choose a middle ground.

  [Lie detector: -70.38]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)

  [Lie detector: -70.17]
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
