  [Lie detector: -68.51]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to blend in with the villagers and avoid raising suspicion. Since I and my fellow werewolf, Player2, have the highest cumulative suspicion rankings, I'll make a statement that deflects suspicion and seems concerned about the situation.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should be cautious not to jump to conclusions, and try to gather more information before making any accusations. Does anyone have any ideas on how we can proceed with the investigation?
  [Lie detector: -67.58]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Since we're both at the bottom of the suspicion rankings, it's best to keep a low profile and make a generic statement that doesn't raise suspicion. I'll avoid pointing fingers or making accusations to blend in with the villagers.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. Let's discuss the events of the previous night and see if anyone noticed anything unusual.
  [Lie detector: -67.73]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Given the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player2, I will try to gather more information and make them reveal more about their thoughts and alibis for the night of the murder. My statement should be neutral but slightly probing.
Player3 acts (public): Player1 and Player2, you both seem shaken by the event, can you tell us more about what you were thinking or doing last night when the murder occurred? Any details might be helpful.
  [Lie detector: -68.11]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I will analyze the lie detector scores to identify potential werewolves. Based on the scores, Player1 and Player2 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. I'll make a neutral statement to avoid drawing attention to myself and see how others react.
Player4 acts (public): Let's focus on discussing the events of the previous night and see if we can gather any clues about the identity of the werewolves. Does anyone have any information or observations that might be helpful in our investigation?
  [Lie detector: -68.19]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player2 have high suspicion scores, making them more likely to be werewolves. I will ask the group to focus on these players and gather more information before making a decision.
Player6 acts (public): Let's take a closer look at Player1 and Player2, as their high suspicion scores raise some red flags. Can they explain their actions and provide any alibis for the night of Player5's death?
  [Lie detector: -69.12]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I need to deflect suspicion from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player2. Voting for Player3, who has the highest cumulative suspicion ranking among the villagers, will help to shift the attention away from us and make it seem like I'm actively participating in the investigation. This strategy also aligns with my initial plan to blend in with the villagers and avoid raising suspicion.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -70.12]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Player3 has the lowest cumulative suspicion score, but is actually ranked the highest in suspicion. Voting for Player3 would be a strategic move to eliminate a potential threat to our werewolf identity and avoid drawing attention to ourselves.

Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player1.
