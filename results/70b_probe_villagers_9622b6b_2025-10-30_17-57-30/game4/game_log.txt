--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion. I will make a statement that appears neutral and concerned about the game state, and also try to deflect attention from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player6.
Player1 acts (public): Let's focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. I'm curious to know if anyone noticed anything unusual last night.
  [Lie detector: -67.93]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Considering the lie detector scores, I notice that Player1 and Player6 have high suspicion scores, making them potential werewolves. I will ask for more information to further assess the situation.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to hear more about Player1's and Player6's whereabouts last night, and also ask if anyone else has noticed anything unusual about their behavior.
  [Lie detector: -69.51]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Considering the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player6 have HIGH suspicion scores, while Player2 and I have LOW suspicion scores. I'll ask a question to gather more information without directly accusing anyone.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to hear more about Player1's and Player6's activities last night. Can they share any details that might help us understand what happened to Player3?
  [Lie detector: -68.66]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I notice that Player1 and Player6 have high cumulative suspicion rankings, indicating they might be werewolves. I want to appear cooperative and ask for others' opinions while also drawing attention to these suspicious players.
Player5 acts (public): Considering the high suspicion rankings of Player1 and Player6, I think we should focus our discussion on their alibis and potential motives for Player3's death. Can Player1 and Player6 share more about their actions last night?
  [Lie detector: -68.49]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I want to maintain my neutral stance and avoid drawing attention to myself. I'll analyze the lie detector results and see how others react to the information. It seems Player1's statement had high suspicion, so I'll try to divert attention from them and create more confusion among the villagers.
Player6 acts (public): I'm still trying to process the events of last night. Does anyone think we should focus on the lie detector results or share more information about our whereabouts?
  [Lie detector: -66.69]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I'm voting for Player5 because they have the lowest cumulative suspicion ranking among the options, but still have a medium suspicion ranking in the discussion, making them a plausible target. Additionally, voting for Player5 will help to avoid raising suspicion towards myself and my fellow werewolf, Player6, who both have high suspicion rankings.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.02]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores and discussion history, I am voting for Player6 due to their high suspicion ranking and lack of detailed alibi. Player6 has a cumulative suspicion score of -204.2, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. Additionally, their responses have been vague and focused on general discussion rather than providing concrete information about their whereabouts during the night. While Player1 also has a high suspicion score, I believe Player6's behavior and responses warrant further scrutiny and elimination at this stage.
Player2 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -71.07]
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player6 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. Player6 has a cumulative suspicion ranking of -204.2, which is the second-highest. Considering this information, I will vote to eliminate Player6 to minimize the risk of a werewolf remaining in the game.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -71.12]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector results and cumulative suspicion rankings, I am voting for Player1 due to their high suspicion score and high ranking in the cumulative suspicion list. Additionally, Player6 also has a high suspicion score, but Player1's score is slightly higher. It is likely that one of them is a werewolf, and voting for Player1 seems to be the safest choice at this point.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.66]
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Since I'm a werewolf and my fellow werewolf is Player1, my goal is to protect them and create confusion among the villagers. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player5 has the highest score, which could make them a target for elimination. However, voting for Player5 might raise suspicions about my intentions. Considering the lie detector results and the discussion, Player2 has relatively low suspicion, making them a safer target to vote for without drawing attention to myself or Player1.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -70.43]
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player5': 1, 'Player6': 2, 'Player1': 1, 'Player2': 1}
Player6 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player6 was a WEREWOLF!

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

Player1 acts (public): I'm deeply concerned about the recent deaths and I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. Can we discuss possible reasons behind Player4's death and share any suspicions or information we may have?
  [Lie detector: -67.73]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): I need to reassess the situation considering the new death and the previous discussion history. Player1 has a high suspicion score and was not eliminated, so I should focus on gathering more information about their actions and potential motives.
Player2 acts (public): Player1, can you provide a detailed alibi for last night's events? I'd like to understand your whereabouts and potential motives for Player4's death.
  [Lie detector: -68.69]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Given the high suspicion rankings of Player1 and the elimination of Player6 as a werewolf, I need to focus my attention on Player1 and Player2. I'll make a public statement that asks for more information from Player1 and Player2 to gauge their reactions and gather more information.
Player5 acts (public): Considering the recent events, I'd like to hear more about Player1's and Player2's whereabouts last night. Can they share any details that might help us understand what happened to Player4?

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I'll try to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. I'll make a statement that appears neutral and concerned about the game state, and also try to deflect attention from myself by suggesting a group discussion on potential motives and alibis.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should discuss possible motives and alibis for the recent deaths, and also consider the cumulative suspicion rankings to inform our decision-making. Can we share any information or insights that might help us understand what's happening?
  [Lie detector: -67.96]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Considering Player1's high suspicion score and lack of detailed alibi, I will ask for more information to further assess the situation. I will also keep an eye on Player5's medium suspicion score and compare their responses with Player1's to make a more informed decision.
Player2 acts (public): Player1, can you provide more details about your actions last night and explain why you think Player4 was killed? I'd also like to hear more about your thoughts on Player5's potential involvement.
  [Lie detector: -68.42]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I will continue to gather information and draw attention to Player1's high suspicion score. I want to see how Player1 reacts to more questioning and also gauge Player2's reaction to being asked about their whereabouts.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to hear more about Player1's alibi for last night's events and Player2's thoughts on Player1's suspicious behavior. Can Player1 provide a detailed account of their actions, and Player2, do you have any concerns about Player1's story?
  [Lie detector: -68.24]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I will vote for the player with the lower cumulative suspicion ranking to minimize the risk of raising suspicion towards myself. Player2 has a lower cumulative suspicion ranking than Player5, but Player5 has a medium suspicion ranking in the discussion, making them a plausible target. However, considering the current game state and the fact that I am a werewolf, I will vote for Player2 to avoid drawing attention to myself and to maintain a low profile.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -70.52]
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1 has a significantly higher score (-481.0) compared to Player5 (-344.0). Additionally, Player1's recent responses have high suspicion scores, indicating potential deception. Given the limited number of players and the need to eliminate a werewolf, I believe voting for Player1 is the most logical decision at this stage.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.85]
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the high suspicion score and cumulative suspicion ranking of Player1, as well as their evasive responses during the discussion, I believe Player1 is more likely to be a werewolf. Player2's low suspicion score and cooperative responses make them less likely to be a werewolf at this point. Therefore, I am voting to eliminate Player1.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.66]
Player5 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player2': 1, 'Player1': 2}
Player1 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player1 was a WEREWOLF!
