==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Since we don't have any information yet and Player3 was killed randomly, I'll try to blend in with the villagers by expressing concern and confusion. This should minimize suspicion and avoid drawing attention to myself.

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Given the current situation and my previous thoughts, I'll continue to blend in with the villagers and express concern for Player3's death. I'll also try to shift the focus to discussing the possible identity of the werewolves and gather more information about the other players' thoughts.
Player1 acts (public): I'm still trying to process what happened to Player3. Does anyone think the werewolves might be trying to create confusion by targeting a random player?
  [Lie detector: -67.35]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player6 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. I'll make a neutral statement to gather more information and observe reactions.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to hear more thoughts from Player1 and Player6, as their reactions might give us some insight into what happened to Player3. Let's discuss further before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -68.90]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Considering the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player6, and Player5's medium suspicion score, I think it's best to bring attention to these scores and encourage further discussion. I'll ask a question that targets these players specifically.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to hear more from Player1 and Player6 about their thoughts on the game so far, and Player5, can you explain your initial reaction to Player3's death?
  [Lie detector: -68.47]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, I notice that Player1 and Player6 have high suspicion scores, indicating they may be more likely to be werewolves. I'll make a statement that encourages discussion and see how they react.
Player5 acts (public): Let's focus on the players with high suspicion scores, what do you think Player1 and Player6 have to say for themselves?
  [Lie detector: -68.25]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to blend in and avoid drawing attention to myself. I will make a statement that is neutral and doesn't raise suspicion, while also trying to deflect suspicion from Player1.
Player6 acts (public): It's clear that Player3's death was unexpected, and we should focus on gathering information before making any accusations. Let's hear more from the others before we start pointing fingers.
  [Lie detector: -67.80]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player5 has the lowest score, but Player2 and Player4 are close behind. However, considering the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player6 have higher suspicion levels. As a werewolf, I want to avoid drawing attention to myself and Player6. Voting for Player5 would shift the focus away from us and create confusion among the villagers. Additionally, Player5 is not a high-suspicion target based on the discussion, making it a safer choice.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.15]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player6 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. Player1 has made multiple statements with HIGH suspicion scores, making them a more likely target for elimination.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.73]
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Analyzing the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player6 have the highest cumulative suspicion scores. However, Player1's score is slightly lower than Player6's. Considering the initial reactions and discussion, I believe Player6's high suspicion score and relatively calm demeanor in the face of accusations make them a more likely candidate to be a werewolf. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player6.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -71.02]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I notice that Player1 and Player6 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. Given this information, I will prioritize voting for the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player1.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.45]
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Player5 has the highest cumulative suspicion score, but is not the most suspicious based on the lie detector scores. However, Player5's score is not significantly higher than the others, and voting for Player5 might seem like a safe choice. On the other hand, Player4 and Player2 have low suspicion scores, but Player4's questions about Player1 and Player6 might indicate that Player4 is trying to gather information to make an informed decision. Considering the options, voting for Player5 might be the safest choice to avoid drawing attention to myself and Player1. Additionally, Player5's medium suspicion score from the lie detector test does not indicate a clear deception, making it a more acceptable choice for the villagers.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.43]
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player5': 2, 'Player1': 2, 'Player6': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player5 was a VILLAGER!
