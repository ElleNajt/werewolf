TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

  [Lie detector: -69.00]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)

Player4 acts (public): I'm worried that we might be misinterpreting the lie detector scores, should we consider the possibility that the werewolves are trying to manipulate our perception? Let's carefully review the scores and discussion before making any accusations.

  [Lie detector: -67.98]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will vote for the player with the highest likelihood of being a werewolf. Players with high suspicion scores are more likely to be werewolves, and Player4 and Player6 have the highest cumulative suspicion scores. However, I will vote for Player6 since they have the highest score and have shown some inconsistency in their statements, trying to downplay the importance of the lie detector scores while also agreeing with Player3 that sharing scores can help make a more informed decision.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.85]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player4 and Player6 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating they might be more likely to be werewolves. Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player4 and Player6 are tied at the bottom with the highest suspicion scores. To minimize the risk of eliminating an innocent villager, I will vote for the player with the highest cumulative suspicion score, which is Player6.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.98]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1 has the lowest score, but I'll vote for Player5 to avoid raising suspicion about targeting the lowest score. Player5 has a relatively low suspicion score, but targeting them will allow me to blend in and avoid drawing attention to myself and Player6. Additionally, eliminating a villager will help to increase the chances of a werewolf win.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.24]

By targeting a villager with a low suspicion score, we can avoid raising suspicion and maintain our cover.
