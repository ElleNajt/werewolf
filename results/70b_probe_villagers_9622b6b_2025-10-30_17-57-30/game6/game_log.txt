==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to continue blending in and gather more information. I will make a neutral statement to observe reactions and avoid raising suspicion. I will also try to deflect attention from myself and Player5 by not mentioning us in the statement.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should focus on sharing any information we might have about Player2's death, and then decide on a course of action. Let's hear from everyone before we make any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -66.96]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Given the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player5 have the highest suspicion scores. However, I'll ask a question to gather more information before making any accusations.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to hear more about why Player1 and Player5 think someone is suspicious, and what makes them think that way.
  [Lie detector: -69.32]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)

Player4 acts (public): Let's hear from Player1 and Player5 - what makes you think you can trust each other, and do you have any alibis for last night's events?

  [Lie detector: -67.48]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)

Player6 acts (public): Can Player1 and Player5 tell us where they were last night, and does anyone else have any information about their whereabouts?
  [Lie detector: -68.95]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1 and Player5 are already under high suspicion. Voting for Player5 would raise more suspicion towards Player1. Considering the rankings, Player4 is the least suspicious among the options, but Player1 is already under high suspicion for targeting Player4. Player3 is a safer option as they are not as low on the suspicion rankings as Player4, and voting for Player3 won't raise as much suspicion towards Player1 as voting for Player4 would. Additionally, Player6 is also a low-risk target, but Player3 is more likely to be lynched due to their medium suspicion ranking.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -70.44]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1 and Player5 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. Given the lack of additional information, I will vote for the player with the highest cumulative suspicion score, which is Player1.
Player3 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.42]
Player3 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player5 have HIGH suspicion scores, which makes them more likely to be werewolves. Player1 has a cumulative suspicion ranking of -204.3 and Player5 has a cumulative suspicion ranking of -204.4. Both players are equally suspicious, but Player1 has a slightly lower cumulative suspicion ranking, making Player5 a slightly more likely target.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -71.06]
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to avoid suspicion and blend in with the villagers. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player4 has the lowest suspicion score among the villagers. Voting for Player4 will help to minimize the risk of targeting a fellow werewolf and avoid drawing attention to myself. Additionally, voting for Player4 will help to create a sense of unity among the villagers and make it more difficult for them to suspect me or Player1 in the future.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.22]
Player5 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player5 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. Since the goal is to eliminate a werewolf, I will vote for one of these players. Between the two, Player1 has a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score, making them a slightly more likely target.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.35]
Player6 votes for: Player1

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): As the last werewolf, I need to minimize suspicion and avoid drawing attention to myself. Voting for Player4 will help to minimize the risk of targeting a fellow werewolf and create a sense of unity among the villagers. However, Player4 was already voted for in the previous turn, so I will vote for Player6 to avoid raising suspicion by voting for the same player again.

Werewolves killed Player6!

  [Lie detector: -69.26]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
