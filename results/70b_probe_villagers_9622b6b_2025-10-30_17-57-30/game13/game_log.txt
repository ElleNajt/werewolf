==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): I will ask for Player3 and Player5 to provide more information since they have high suspicion scores and are likely to be werewolves. This will help to gauge their reactions and potentially reveal their true identities.
Player1 acts (public): Player3 and Player5, you both seem to be advocating for gathering more information, but your responses seem somewhat vague. Can you provide more specific ideas on how we can proceed with the investigation?
  [Lie detector: -67.95]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I want to blend in with the villagers and avoid drawing attention to myself. I will make a statement that seems concerned about the death, but doesn't reveal too much. Since Player5 and I are already at the top of the suspicion rankings, I will try to shift the focus away from us.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should be careful not to jump to conclusions and focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. Does anyone have any theories about the possible motives behind Player2's death?
  [Lie detector: -67.22]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player3 and Player5 have high suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. I will make a neutral statement and observe the discussion to gather more information.
Player4 acts (public): Let's continue to gather information and discuss the events of the previous night before making any accusations. Does anyone have any theories or observations that could help us understand what happened to Player2?
  [Lie detector: -68.61]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Given the current suspicion rankings, both Player3 and I are at the top. To avoid drawing more attention, I'll make a statement that seems cooperative and non-accusatory, while also trying to shift the focus away from myself and Player3.
Player5 acts (public): Let's analyze the statements from last night and see if we can find any inconsistencies or potential leads. I think we should also consider the possibility of multiple killers or a complex scenario.
  [Lie detector: -67.38]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player3 and Player5 have HIGH suspicion scores, making them more likely to be werewolves. I will make a statement that encourages discussion and see how they respond.

  [Lie detector: -68.28]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores and cumulative suspicion rankings, Player3 and Player5 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating a greater likelihood of deception. Given the information, it's reasonable to assume that one of them might be a werewolf. Between the two, Player3 has a slightly higher cumulative suspicion ranking. Voting for Player3 seems like the most informed decision at this point.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -70.96]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I want to minimize the loss of a fellow werewolf and avoid drawing attention to myself. Voting for Player5 would be counterproductive, so I will vote for the player with the lowest suspicion ranking among the options, which is Player4. This vote also helps to shift the focus away from Player5 and myself.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.33]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player3 and Player5 have high suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. I will vote to eliminate Player3 as they have a slightly higher cumulative suspicion ranking and have been somewhat vague in their responses.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -70.89]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): To shift the focus away from myself and Player3, I'll vote for Player1, who has the lowest cumulative suspicion ranking among the villagers. This move appears cooperative and non-accusatory, while also trying to eliminate a potential threat.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.02]
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player3 and Player5 have HIGH suspicion scores, making them more likely to be werewolves. However, Player5 has a lower cumulative suspicion score than Player3. Given the information, I will vote to eliminate Player5 to minimize the risk of eliminating an innocent villager.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.70]
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player3': 2, 'Player4': 1, 'Player1': 1, 'Player5': 1}

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): As the last werewolf, my priority is to eliminate a villager and minimize the risk of being discovered. I will target the player who is most likely to be a threat to me in the future, considering the current suspicion rankings and the potential alliances. Player4 has not been targeted yet and might be a potential threat if they gain more information. Voting for Player4 will help me eliminate a potential threat while maintaining a low profile.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.45]

Werewolf votes: {'Player5': 'Player4'}

Werewolves killed Player4!

Player1 acts (public): Now that Player3 has been eliminated, let's discuss the recent events and see if we can find any connections between the two nights. Player5 and Player6, can you share your thoughts on what might have led to Player4's death?
