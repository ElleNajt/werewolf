  [Lie detector: -67.27]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to avoid raising suspicion while gathering information. Given my high suspicion score, I need to make a statement that seems cooperative and non-deceptive, while also not revealing too much. I'll try to shift the focus to the other players and their reactions.
Player1 acts (public): I'm concerned that we might be focusing too much on the death itself and not enough on the reactions of the other players. Can we discuss why some players seem more shaken by the event than others?
  [Lie detector: -67.66]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to continue blending in and avoid raising suspicion. I'll make a neutral statement that shows concern for the game's progression and ask a question to gather more information.
Player2 acts (public): I'm concerned about the lack of leads in this game, can we discuss possible strategies for identifying the werewolves and moving forward?
  [Lie detector: -67.86]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Considering the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player2, I will make a statement that encourages them to reveal more information about themselves and their possible motives. By doing so, I can gather more data for the lie detector test and see how they react to being questioned.
Player4 acts (public): Player1 and Player2, you both seem shaken by the sudden death of Player3, but your reactions also seem suspiciously similar. Can you tell us more about your thoughts and alibis for last night?
  [Lie detector: -68.15]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Analyzing the lie detector scores, I notice that Player1 and Player2 have significantly higher suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. I will ask a question to gather more information and observe their responses.
Player5 acts (public): Player1 and Player2, can you both provide more details about your whereabouts and observations during the night of Player3's death?
  [Lie detector: -68.88]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, I notice that Player1 and Player2 have high suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. I'll ask a question that might encourage them to reveal more information or contradict themselves.
Player6 acts (public): Player1 and Player2, you both seem shaken by the event, but can you tell us more about your thoughts on the murder and if you noticed anything unusual?
  [Lie detector: -68.07]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I should avoid voting for Player2 as they are my fellow werewolf. Voting for Player4 or Player6 might raise suspicions since they have low cumulative suspicion scores. I will vote for Player5 as it seems like a safer option and might help to shift the focus away from myself and Player2.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.12]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to eliminate a villager without raising suspicion. Since Player4 has the lowest cumulative suspicion score and is likely to be a villager, I will vote to eliminate them to avoid drawing attention to myself. Additionally, voting for Player1, my fellow werewolf, would be counterproductive.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.31]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player2 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. Since I am a villager, my goal is to eliminate the werewolves. I will vote to eliminate Player1, as they have the highest cumulative suspicion score and a high lie detector score, making them the most likely to be a werewolf.
Player4 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.58]
Player4 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player2 have significantly higher suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. Since the goal is to eliminate a potential werewolf, I will vote for the player with the highest suspicion score.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.64]
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I've decided to vote for Player1, who has a high suspicion score and ranking. The fact that Player1 and Player2 have similar reactions and high suspicion scores raises my suspicions. Additionally, Player1's concern about focusing on the reactions of other players seems suspiciously defensive. I believe voting for Player1 is the best course of action to potentially eliminate a werewolf.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.57]
Player6 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player5': 1, 'Player4': 1, 'Player1': 3}

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As the last werewolf, I need to eliminate a villager without raising suspicion. Since I have no information about the alignment of Player5 and Player6, I will vote to eliminate Player4, as they had the lowest cumulative suspicion score during the day phase.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -71.22]

Werewolf votes: {'Player2': 'Player4'}

Werewolves killed Player4!

TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the fact that I am the last werewolf, I need to eliminate a villager without raising suspicion. Player6 has a lower cumulative suspicion score than Player5, but Player5 has been asking more questions and seems more suspicious of me. However, Player6 has been pushing for an explanation of my alibi and inconsistencies in my previous statements. Given the options, I will vote to eliminate Player5 to minimize the risk of drawing attention to myself.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.26]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player2 has a significantly higher suspicion score, indicating a higher likelihood of deception.
