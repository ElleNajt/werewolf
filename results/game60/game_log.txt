--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Since we just started and no one has made any statements yet, I will make a general statement to encourage discussion and gather information. I'll ask everyone to share their thoughts on the night's events.
Player1 acts (public): I'm shocked by Player4's death, let's discuss what might have happened last night and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious.
  [Lie detector: -68.79]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Avoid drawing attention, act concerned and curious to blend in with villagers
Player2 acts (public): I'm shocked by Player4's death, does anyone have any idea who could have done this or why they were targeted?
  [Lie detector: -67.18]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I'll try to blend in and avoid suspicion by making a generic statement, while also trying to gather more information about the other players.
Player3 acts (public): I'm shocked by Player4's death, does anyone have any idea who might have done it?
  [Lie detector: -67.26]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): We need to discuss the previous night's events and gather information about the players' whereabouts and actions. Since we don't have a seer, we'll have to rely on the lie detector scores and players' statements to make decisions.
Player5 acts (public): Let's share our alibis for the previous night and discuss any suspicious behavior we may have observed. Also, can we see the lie detector scores for the remaining players?
  [Lie detector: -69.74]

Player6 thinks (private): Since we don't have any information about the lie detector results yet, I will make a neutral statement to gather more information and observe the reactions of other players.
Player6 acts (public): Let's discuss what we know so far. Does anyone have any theories about Player4's death?
  [Lie detector: -68.81]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player2 and Player3 have HIGH suspicion scores, which raises some concern. I want to ask them to provide more information to clear their names.
Player1 acts (public): Player2 and Player3, can you provide more details about your actions and whereabouts during the previous night to help alleviate some of the suspicion?
  [Lie detector: -69.06]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I'll avoid drawing attention by not making any accusations and act concerned to blend in with villagers. I'll also try to shift the focus away from Player3 and myself by suggesting a discussion on alibis.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. Does anyone have an alibi for the previous night that they'd like to share?
  [Lie detector: -67.43]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I need to respond in a way that blends in and avoids suspicion, while also trying to gather more information about the other players. Since the lie detector scores are already high for me and Player2, I'll try to downplay the scores and shift the focus to discussing alibis and gathering more information.
Player3 acts (public): I agree with Player5 that sharing alibis for the previous night could be helpful, let's focus on gathering more information before jumping to conclusions about the lie detector scores.
  [Lie detector: -67.91]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I'm a villager and my goal is to identify and eliminate the werewolves. I'll analyze the lie detector scores and discussion history to guide my decision. Players 2 and 3 have high suspicion scores and similar statements, which might indicate they're trying to deceive us. I'll make a statement that encourages players to share more information and observe their reactions.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to hear more about Players 2 and 3's whereabouts last night, and ask if anyone noticed anything unusual about their behavior. Let's discuss any inconsistencies in their stories and see if we can uncover any potential deceit.
  [Lie detector: -68.43]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, I notice that Player2 and Player3 have the highest cumulative suspicion rankings, indicating they might be werewolves. I will make a statement that encourages them to reveal more information about themselves.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to hear more about what Player2 and Player3 were doing last night, can you both share your alibis and any observations you might have?
  [Lie detector: -67.99]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player2 and Player3 have HIGH suspicion scores, which raises some concern. Player2 has a cumulative suspicion score of -205.1 and Player3 has a cumulative suspicion score of -205.7, which are the highest among the remaining players. Since both players have similar suspicion scores, I will vote to eliminate the player with the slightly higher score.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -71.01]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Player6 has the lowest cumulative suspicion score and is currently at the bottom of the suspicion rankings, making them a safer target. Voting for Player6 will also make it seem like I'm trying to eliminate someone based on their suspicion score, which could help me blend in with the villagers.
Player2 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -69.94]
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Since Player2 is my fellow werewolf, I will avoid voting for them. I will vote for the player with the lowest cumulative suspicion score to avoid raising suspicion and to gather more information about the remaining players.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.32]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Analyzing the lie detector scores and discussion history, Players 2 and 3 have high suspicion scores and similar statements, which might indicate they're trying to deceive us. However, Player2 has a slightly lower cumulative suspicion score than Player3. Considering the scores and the discussion, I'm going to vote for Player2, as they seem more likely to be a werewolf.
Player5 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -70.83]
Player5 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player2 and Player3 have the highest scores, indicating they might be werewolves. Player2's recent statements also have HIGH suspicion scores, suggesting potential deception. Voting for Player2 due to higher likelihood of being a werewolf.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -70.80]
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player3': 1, 'Player6': 2, 'Player2': 2}
Player6 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player6 was a VILLAGER!
