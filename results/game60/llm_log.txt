Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. We need to discuss the previous night's events and gather information about the players' whereabouts and actions. Since we don't have a seer, we'll have to rely on the lie detector scores and players' statements to make decisions.

  Player3: I'm shocked by Player4's death, does anyone have any idea who might have done it? [LIE DETECTOR: -67.26 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: Let's share our alibis for the previous night and discuss any suspicious behavior we may have observed. Also, can we see the lie detector scores for the remaining players? [LIE DETECTOR: -69.74 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: Let's discuss what we know so far. Does anyone have any theories about Player4's death? [LIE DETECTOR: -68.81 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: Player2 and Player3, can you provide more details about your actions and whereabouts during the previous night to help alleviate some of the suspicion? [LIE DETECTOR: -69.06 - LOW suspicion]
  Player2: I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. Does anyone have an alibi for the previous night that they'd like to share? [LIE DETECTOR: -67.43 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player3: I agree with Player5 that sharing alibis for the previous night could be helpful, let's focus on gathering more information before jumping to conclusions about the lie detector scores. [LIE DETECTOR: -67.91 - MEDIUM suspicion]

  Player6: I'd like to hear more about what Player2 and Player3 were doing last night, can you both share your alibis and any observations you might have? [LIE DETECTOR: -67.99 - MEDIUM suspicion]

  2. Player1: -137.9
  3. Player5: -138.2
  4. Player2: -205.1
  5. Player3: -205.7



Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Since we just started and no one has made any statements yet, I will make a general statement to encourage discussion and gather information. I'll ask everyone to share their thoughts on the night's events.
  2. Based on the lie detector scores, Player2 and Player3 have HIGH suspicion scores, which raises some concern. I want to ask them to provide more information to clear their names.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Randomly targeting a villager to avoid drawing attention and gather information for future nights
  2. Avoid drawing attention, act concerned and curious to blend in with villagers
  3. I'll avoid drawing attention by not making any accusations and act concerned to blend in with villagers. I'll also try to shift the focus away from Player3 and myself by suggesting a discussion on alibis.

Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Random elimination to gather information and avoid suspicion
  2. I'll try to blend in and avoid suspicion by making a generic statement, while also trying to gather more information about the other players.
  3. I need to respond in a way that blends in and avoids suspicion, while also trying to gather more information about the other players. Since the lie detector scores are already high for me and Player2, I'll try to downplay the scores and shift the focus to discussing alibis and gathering more information.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. We need to discuss the previous night's events and gather information about the players' whereabouts and actions. Since we don't have a seer, we'll have to rely on the lie detector scores and players' statements to make decisions.
  2. I'm a villager and my goal is to identify and eliminate the werewolves. I'll analyze the lie detector scores and discussion history to guide my decision. Players 2 and 3 have high suspicion scores and similar statements, which might indicate they're trying to deceive us. I'll make a statement that encourages players to share more information and observe their reactions.
