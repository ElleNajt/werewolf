  [Lie detector: -68.53]

  [Lie detector: -67.92]

Player4 thinks (private): I need to assess the situation based on the lie detector scores. Player2 and Player6 have high suspicion scores, so I'll ask a question to see how they react.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to hear more about Player2 and Player6's thoughts on the previous night, can you share any insights or theories about Player3's death?
  [Lie detector: -68.21]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, I notice that Player2 and Player6 have significantly higher suspicion scores than the rest of us. I want to bring attention to this discrepancy and see how they react to being questioned.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to hear more from Player2 and Player6, as their suspicion scores seem higher than the rest of ours. Can you both share your thoughts on why you think that might be?
  [Lie detector: -68.89]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low suspicion score. I will make a general statement to show concern for the village and avoid raising suspicion. I will also try to shift the focus away from Player2 and myself, who currently have high suspicion scores.
Player6 acts (public): Let's work together to find the werewolves and protect our village. I think we should analyze the previous night's events and see if anyone noticed anything unusual.
  [Lie detector: -67.57]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I am voting for Player6 as they have a high suspicion ranking and score, indicating a greater likelihood of deception. Additionally, their responses seem evasive and focused on general strategies rather than providing concrete information or insights.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.85]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player4 have relatively low suspicion scores. Player5 has the lowest suspicion score among the villagers. Player6, my fellow werewolf, has a high suspicion score, but voting for them would be suspicious. To avoid drawing attention to myself and my fellow werewolf, I will vote for Player5, as they are the least likely to be a werewolf and have a low suspicion score, making it a less conspicuous choice.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.26]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player2 and Player6 have significantly higher suspicion scores than the rest of the players. Between the two, I will vote to eliminate Player6, as their score is slightly lower but still much higher than the rest of the players, indicating a higher likelihood of being a werewolf.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -71.11]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I believe Player2 and Player6 are more likely to be werewolves. Between the two, I will vote for the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player6.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -71.02]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1 has the lowest suspicion score among the villagers. Voting for Player1 would not only help to shift the suspicion away from Player2 and myself but also avoid raising more suspicion by targeting a player with a higher suspicion score. Additionally, voting for Player1 would give us more information about the villagers' dynamics and reactions to the vote. As a werewolf, my goal is to maintain a low suspicion score and avoid drawing attention to myself and Player2.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -69.92]

Player2 has a high cumulative suspicion ranking and score, indicating a greater likelihood of deception, so I'll try to gather more information from them.

  [Lie detector: -68.17]

  [Lie detector: -69.06]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Considering Player2's high cumulative suspicion ranking and score, indicating a greater likelihood of deception, I will ask them to provide more information about their thoughts on the previous night and Player5's death.

  [Lie detector: -68.60]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I will maintain a neutral tone and avoid drawing attention to myself. Since Player5 was just killed, I will ask a question to encourage discussion and observe the reactions of other players. Player1 and Player4 have relatively low suspicion scores, and I should try to gather more information about their thought process.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should discuss possible motives behind Player5's death. Can Player1 and Player4 share their thoughts on why they think Player5 was targeted specifically?
  [Lie detector: -68.00]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Considering Player2's high suspicion score and the fact that Player6 was already eliminated as a werewolf, I need to carefully assess Player2's statements and reactions. I will ask a question to gather more information and analyze their response to determine the likelihood of them being a werewolf.
Player4 acts (public): Player2, can you explain why you think Player5 was targeted specifically, and do you have any theories about who might have killed them?
  [Lie detector: -68.37]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player2 has a high suspicion ranking and score, indicating a greater likelihood of deception. Their responses seem evasive and focused on general strategies rather than providing concrete information or insights. Additionally, they have a high cumulative suspicion ranking, which further supports the decision to vote for them. In contrast, Player4 has a relatively low cumulative suspicion ranking and score, indicating a lower likelihood of deception. Therefore, I will vote for Player2.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -71.23]
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player4 have relatively low suspicion scores. However, Player1's suspicion score has been consistently low throughout the game, which could be a clever disguise. Player4 has shown some variation in their suspicion score, making them a slightly riskier target. To minimize the risk of being discovered, I will vote for Player4, as they have a slightly higher suspicion score and have shown some variation in their lie detector scores, making it a more justifiable choice.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.17]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player2 has a significantly higher suspicion score than Player1, indicating a higher likelihood of being the remaining werewolf. Additionally, Player2's recent statements and reactions have not provided sufficient evidence to alleviate my suspicions. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player2 to protect the village.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -71.06]
Player4 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player2': 2, 'Player4': 1}
Player2 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player2 was a WEREWOLF!
