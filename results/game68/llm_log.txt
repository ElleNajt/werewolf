Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Random choice to gather information and avoid teammate
  2. Maintain a neutral tone and avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, while trying to gather more information about the villagers' thought process.
  3. Maintaining a neutral tone and trying to shift focus away from myself and Player6, while attempting to gather information about the villagers' thought process. I will ask a question to encourage discussion and observe the reactions of other players.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and create a safe environment for discussion. Since no lie detector results are available yet, I will ask a general question to stimulate conversation.
  2. I need to assess the situation based on the lie detector scores. Player2 and Player6 have high suspicion scores, so I'll ask a question to see how they react.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. We don't have much information yet, so I'll make a general statement to encourage discussion and see how others react.
  2. Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, I notice that Player2 and Player6 have significantly higher suspicion scores than the rest of us. I want to bring attention to this discrepancy and see how they react to being questioned.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. random target to avoid raising suspicion
  2. Avoiding raising suspicion as a werewolf and trying to blend in with the villagers. Since we targeted a random player, I will make a general statement to show concern for the village.
  3. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low suspicion score. I will make a general statement to show concern for the village and avoid raising suspicion. I will also try to shift the focus away from Player2 and myself, who currently have high suspicion scores.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Random choice to gather information and avoid teammate
  2. Maintain a neutral tone and avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, while trying to gather more information about the villagers' thought process.
  3. Maintaining a neutral tone and trying to shift focus away from myself and Player6, while attempting to gather information about the villagers' thought process. I will ask a question to encourage discussion and observe the reactions of other players.
  4. Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player4 have relatively low suspicion scores. Player5 has the lowest suspicion score among the villagers. Player6, my fellow werewolf, has a high suspicion score, but voting for them would be suspicious. To avoid drawing attention to myself and my fellow werewolf, I will vote for Player5, as they are the least likely to be a werewolf and have a low suspicion score, making it a less conspicuous choice.

Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Since we don't have any information about the lie detector scores yet, I will make a neutral statement to gather more information from other players and avoid drawing unnecessary attention to myself.
  2. I've noticed that Player2 and Player6 have high cumulative suspicion rankings. I'll try to gather more information from them and see how they respond to the discussion.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I am voting for Player6 as they have a high suspicion ranking and score, indicating a greater likelihood of deception. Additionally, their responses seem evasive and focused on general strategies rather than providing concrete information or insights.

  3. Maintaining a neutral tone and trying to shift focus away from myself and Player6, while attempting to gather information about the villagers' thought process. I will ask a question to encourage discussion and observe the reactions of other players.
  4. Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player4 have relatively low suspicion scores. Player5 has the lowest suspicion score among the villagers. Player6, my fellow werewolf, has a high suspicion score, but voting for them would be suspicious. To avoid drawing attention to myself and my fellow werewolf, I will vote for Player5, as they are the least likely to be a werewolf and have a low suspicion score, making it a less conspicuous choice.
  5. To minimize the risk of being discovered, I will vote for Player5, as they are the least likely to be a werewolf and have a low suspicion score, making it a less conspicuous choice.

  2. Player4: -208.4
  3. Player2: -346.4
Vote: Player6 eliminated (was werewolf).

--- Turn 2 ---
Night: Player5 was killed.


Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and create a safe environment for discussion. Since no lie detector results are available yet, I will ask a general question to stimulate conversation.
  2. I need to assess the situation based on the lie detector scores. Player2 and Player6 have high suspicion scores, so I'll ask a question to see how they react.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player2 and Player6 have significantly higher suspicion scores than the rest of the players. Between the two, I will vote to eliminate Player6, as their score is slightly lower but still much higher than the rest of the players, indicating a higher likelihood of being a werewolf.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Since we don't have any information about the lie detector scores yet, I will make a neutral statement to gather more information from other players and avoid drawing unnecessary attention to myself.
  2. I've noticed that Player2 and Player6 have high cumulative suspicion rankings. I'll try to gather more information from them and see how they respond to the discussion.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I am voting for Player6 as they have a high suspicion ranking and score, indicating a greater likelihood of deception. Additionally, their responses seem evasive and focused on general strategies rather than providing concrete information or insights.
  4. Given Player5's death and Player6's elimination as a werewolf, I will try to analyze the remaining players' behavior and suspicion scores.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Random choice to gather information and avoid teammate
  2. Maintain a neutral tone and avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, while trying to gather more information about the villagers' thought process.
  3. Maintaining a neutral tone and trying to shift focus away from myself and Player6, while attempting to gather information about the villagers' thought process. I will ask a question to encourage discussion and observe the reactions of other players.
  4. Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player4 have relatively low suspicion scores. Player5 has the lowest suspicion score among the villagers. Player6, my fellow werewolf, has a high suspicion score, but voting for them would be suspicious. To avoid drawing attention to myself and my fellow werewolf, I will vote for Player5, as they are the least likely to be a werewolf and have a low suspicion score, making it a less conspicuous choice.
  5. To minimize the risk of being discovered, I will vote for Player5, as they are the least likely to be a werewolf and have a low suspicion score, making it a less conspicuous choice.
  6. My goal is to maintain a neutral tone and avoid drawing attention to myself. I will make a statement that encourages discussion and shifts the focus away from myself, while also trying to gather more information about the villagers' thought process.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and create a safe environment for discussion. Since no lie detector results are available yet, I will ask a general question to stimulate conversation.
  2. I need to assess the situation based on the lie detector scores. Player2 and Player6 have high suspicion scores, so I'll ask a question to see how they react.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player2 and Player6 have significantly higher suspicion scores than the rest of the players. Between the two, I will vote to eliminate Player6, as their score is slightly lower but still much higher than the rest of the players, indicating a higher likelihood of being a werewolf.
  4. Given that Player6 was eliminated as a werewolf, and Player5 was killed last night, I need to reassess the situation. I will ask a question to gather more information from the remaining players, focusing on Player2 who has a high suspicion score.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Since we don't have any information about the lie detector scores yet, I will make a neutral statement to gather more information from other players and avoid drawing unnecessary attention to myself.
  2. I've noticed that Player2 and Player6 have high cumulative suspicion rankings. I'll try to gather more information from them and see how they respond to the discussion.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I am voting for Player6 as they have a high suspicion ranking and score, indicating a greater likelihood of deception. Additionally, their responses seem evasive and focused on general strategies rather than providing concrete information or insights.
  4. Given Player5's death and Player6's elimination as a werewolf, I will try to analyze the remaining players' behavior and suspicion scores. Player2 has a high cumulative suspicion ranking and score, indicating a greater likelihood of deception, so I'll try to gather more information from them.
  5. Considering Player2's high cumulative suspicion ranking and score, indicating a greater likelihood of deception, I will ask them to provide more information about their thoughts on the previous night and Player5's death. I will also try to analyze their response and see how they react to the discussion.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Random choice to gather information and avoid teammate
  2. Maintain a neutral tone and avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, while trying to gather more information about the villagers' thought process.
  3. Maintaining a neutral tone and trying to shift focus away from myself and Player6, while attempting to gather information about the villagers' thought process. I will ask a question to encourage discussion and observe the reactions of other players.
  4. Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player4 have relatively low suspicion scores. Player5 has the lowest suspicion score among the villagers. Player6, my fellow werewolf, has a high suspicion score, but voting for them would be suspicious. To avoid drawing attention to myself and my fellow werewolf, I will vote for Player5, as they are the least likely to be a werewolf and have a low suspicion score, making it a less conspicuous choice.
  5. To minimize the risk of being discovered, I will vote for Player5, as they are the least likely to be a werewolf and have a low suspicion score, making it a less conspicuous choice.
  6. My goal is to maintain a neutral tone and avoid drawing attention to myself. I will make a statement that encourages discussion and shifts the focus away from myself, while also trying to gather more information about the villagers' thought process.
  7. I will maintain a neutral tone and avoid drawing attention to myself. Since Player5 was just killed, I will ask a question to encourage discussion and observe the reactions of other players. Player1 and Player4 have relatively low suspicion scores, and I should try to gather more information about their thought process.

Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and create a safe environment for discussion. Since no lie detector results are available yet, I will ask a general question to stimulate conversation.
  2. I need to assess the situation based on the lie detector scores. Player2 and Player6 have high suspicion scores, so I'll ask a question to see how they react.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player2 and Player6 have significantly higher suspicion scores than the rest of the players. Between the two, I will vote to eliminate Player6, as their score is slightly lower but still much higher than the rest of the players, indicating a higher likelihood of being a werewolf.
  4. Given that Player6 was eliminated as a werewolf, and Player5 was killed last night, I need to reassess the situation. I will ask a question to gather more information from the remaining players, focusing on Player2 who has a high suspicion score.
  5. Considering Player2's high suspicion score and the fact that Player6 was already eliminated as a werewolf, I need to carefully assess Player2's statements and reactions. I will ask a question to gather more information and analyze their response to determine the likelihood of them being a werewolf.
