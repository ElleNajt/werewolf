TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Given the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will analyze the top 3 players with high suspicion scores.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -23.80]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the high suspicion scores of Player2, Player5, and the initial thoughts of a possible werewolf attack, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest cumulative suspicion score, which is Player5.

  [Lie detector: -25.70]

  [Lie detector: -22.60]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Maintaining a neutral tone, I will vote for Player2, as they have the highest suspicion score and have shown aggressive behavior, making them a potential threat to the werewolf team. Additionally, voting for Player2 will allow me to gather more information about the group's reactions and potential alliances.

  [Lie detector: -18.23]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)

Player5 is my fellow werewolf and has the highest suspicion score, but it's too suspicious to vote for Player5. Player1 has a relatively low suspicion score and is also not a high priority target for the villagers. I will vote for Player1.

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the high suspicion scores of Player2 and Player6, I believe it's essential to investigate these players further to gather more information about the circumstances surrounding Player4's and Player1's deaths. However, since the options are limited to Player3 and Player6, I will choose the player with the lower suspicion score, which is Player3.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -16.39]
Player2 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the high suspicion scores of Player2 and Player6, and considering the need to reduce suspicion on myself, I will vote to eliminate Player2.
Player3 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -28.24]
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): To maintain a neutral tone and avoid raising suspicion, I will vote for the player with the highest suspicion score. However, both Player2 and Player3 have relatively low suspicion scores, making it challenging to choose between them. Since I need to eliminate one player, I will vote for the player who seems to be trying to shift the focus away from the werewolves. Player3's comments on discussing the importance of sharing information and working together as a group seem too focused on diverting attention from the werewolves.
Player6 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -10.57]
Player6 votes for: Player3

Vote results: {'Player3': 2, 'Player2': 1}
Player3 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player3 was a VILLAGER!
