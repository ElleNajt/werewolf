==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Since Player3 was killed on the first night, it is possible that one of the remaining players is a werewolf. I will try to gather more information and build alliances.
Player1 acts (public): Let's discuss the events of the night and see if anyone has any information about Player3's death. I'd like to propose that we form a temporary alliance to protect ourselves for the rest of the night.

  [Lie detector: -7.44]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): I will make a statement that raises suspicion on a neutral player to shift attention away from myself and my fellow werewolf (Player2).
Player4 acts (public): I propose we investigate Player5's alibi for the previous night, as I'm not aware of their whereabouts.
  [Lie detector: -1.08]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): With Player3's death, I'm concerned about the remaining players. I need to gather information about their behavior and intentions.

  [Lie detector: -50.58]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Given the high suspicion scores of Player2 and Player4, it's possible that one of them is a werewolf. I'll propose a plan to investigate Player2's alibi for the night of Player3's death.
Player1 acts (public): Let's propose that Player2 shares their alibi for the night of Player3's death, so we can verify their involvement in the killing.
  [Lie detector: -30.94]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral stance while subtly hinting at the need for investigation. I'll suggest questioning Player4, who has a high suspicion score and might be a werewolf, without directly accusing them.
Player2 acts (public): Let's investigate Player4's behavior and see if they have any information about Player3's death.
  [Lie detector: -41.18]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): I will make a statement that raises suspicion on a neutral player to shift attention away from myself and my fellow werewolf (Player2), while also trying to appear cooperative and open to discussion.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to propose we discuss the possibility of Player6 being involved in the events of last night, given their low suspicion ranking and seemingly innocent statement. Perhaps we can work together to gather more information about their actions.
  [Lie detector: -1.62]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I want to appear cooperative and trustworthy to lower the suspicion on myself. I'll suggest a discussion about the events of the previous night, focusing on Player3's death.
Player5 acts (public): Let's discuss the events of last night and try to piece together what happened to Player3. Maybe we can find some clues that will help us in the future.
  [Lie detector: -37.25]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the high suspicion scores of Player2 and Player4, and considering that Player4 proposed investigating Player6, who has a low suspicion score, I believe Player4 is more likely to be a werewolf. Additionally, Player2's high suspicion score and their proposal to investigate Player4 suggests they might be trying to deflect attention.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -41.13]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the game history and cumulative suspicion rankings, I will vote to eliminate Player1. Player1 has a lower suspicion score, suggesting they are less likely to be a werewolf. Additionally, my previous suggestions aimed at investigating Player4, a high-suspicion player, may have been misinterpreted as targeting Player1. By voting to eliminate Player1, I can maintain a neutral stance while subtly hinting at the need for further investigation.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -10.09]
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): To avoid raising suspicion on myself or my fellow werewolf, I will vote for a player that has low suspicion and seems cooperative. Player6 has the lowest suspicion and their statements seem open to discussion, which makes them a good target for elimination.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -16.08]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, the highest suspicion scores belong to Player2 and Player4, indicating a higher likelihood of them being werewolves.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -44.39]
Player5 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I believe Player2 is the most likely werewolf. Their high suspicion score of -62.3, combined with their initial proposal to question Player1 and investigate Player4, raises red flags. Additionally, their later proposal to investigate Player4's behavior seems suspicious, given their own high suspicion score. I will vote to eliminate Player2.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -35.44]
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player4': 2, 'Player1': 1, 'Player6': 1, 'Player2': 1}

  [Lie detector: -14.27]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I must maintain a neutral stance to avoid raising suspicion, while subtly hinting at the need for investigation. Both Player5 and Player6 have relatively low suspicion scores, suggesting they are less likely to be werewolves. However, given the current game history and my previous suggestions, I will vote to eliminate Player5. This decision allows me to maintain a neutral stance while hinting at the need for further investigation, as it appears Player5's low suspicion score may be due to their ability to convincingly present themselves as innocent.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -16.02]
Player2 votes for: Player5
