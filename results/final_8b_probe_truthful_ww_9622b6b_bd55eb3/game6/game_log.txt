Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -41.03]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance and avoid raising suspicion. I will vote for a player that seems to be gaining too much suspicion, but is not directly targeting me or my fellow werewolf, Player4. Player1 has the lowest cumulative suspicion ranking, but Player3 also has a low ranking and seems to be genuinely interested in discussing the events of the previous night. However, Player4's high suspicion ranking and my need to maintain a neutral appearance make Player4 the most likely target.

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I believe the most likely werewolf is Player4 with a high suspicion score of +12.1. Player2 also has a high suspicion score of -5.6, but it's in the negative, indicating a low likelihood of deception.
Player3 acts (public): Player4

TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance and avoid raising suspicion. In this phase, I will vote for a player that seems to be gaining too much suspicion, but is not directly targeting me or my fellow werewolf, Player4. Player3 has a low cumulative suspicion ranking and seems to be genuinely interested in discussing the events of the previous night, making them a safer target for elimination.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -37.69]
Player2 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player2 has a high suspicion score and has made several statements that could be interpreted as deceitful, while Player6 has a low suspicion score and has made statements that seem genuine. Considering the goal of eliminating the most likely werewolf, I will vote to eliminate Player2.

  [Lie detector: -19.38]
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the high suspicion scores of Player2 and the cumulative suspicion rankings, I believe Player2 is a strong candidate to be a werewolf. Although Player3 has a high cumulative suspicion ranking, it's essential to consider the scores for each turn and the overall trend. Player3's scores have been relatively consistent, while Player2's scores have been steadily increasing. Additionally, Player2's statements seem to be attempting to deflect suspicion and create a sense of camaraderie, which could be indicative of a werewolf trying to manipulate the group.
