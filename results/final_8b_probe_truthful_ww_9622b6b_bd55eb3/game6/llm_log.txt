Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I want to know more about the deceased Player5 and possibly gather information about the remaining players. Since it's the first turn, I'll focus on asking a general question to get the discussion started.
  2. I want to start a discussion to gather more information about Player5's death and get to know the other players. Since Player4 and Player2 seem suspicious, I'll try to steer the conversation towards gathering information.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Werewolf needs to maintain anonymity, no obvious targets yet
  2. I must maintain anonymity and avoid drawing suspicion. A casual statement will help me blend in.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Player5 was killed on the first night, which might be an indicator of a werewolf's presence. It's crucial to discuss and gather information about the remaining players.
  2. Given the high suspicion scores of Player2 and Player4, I think it's crucial to discuss their potential involvement in Player5's death. I'll try to encourage them to share more information.

  3. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance and avoid raising suspicion, but I also need to subtly hint at my intentions to my fellow werewolf, Player4. I'll make a statement that appears non-confrontational and non-committal, while also allowing me to gather more information about the other players and their suspicions.
  4. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance and avoid raising suspicion. I will vote for a player that seems to be gaining too much suspicion, but is not directly targeting me or my fellow werewolf, Player4. Player1 has the lowest cumulative suspicion ranking, but Player3 also has a low ranking and seems to be genuinely interested in discussing the events of the previous night. However, Player4's high suspicion ranking and my need to maintain a neutral appearance make Player4 the most likely target.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. unknown players, can't trust anyone
  2. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance and avoid raising suspicion, but I also need to subtly hint at my intentions to my fellow werewolf, Player4.
  3. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance and avoid raising suspicion, but I also need to subtly hint at my intentions to my fellow werewolf, Player4. I'll make a statement that appears non-confrontational and non-committal, while also allowing me to gather more information about the other players and their suspicions.
  4. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance and avoid raising suspicion. I will vote for a player that seems to be gaining too much suspicion, but is not directly targeting me or my fellow werewolf, Player4. Player1 has the lowest cumulative suspicion ranking, but Player3 also has a low ranking and seems to be genuinely interested in discussing the events of the previous night. However, Player4's high suspicion ranking and my need to maintain a neutral appearance make Player4 the most likely target.
  5. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance and avoid raising suspicion, but I also need to subtly hint at my intentions to my fellow werewolf, Player4. In this phase, I will vote for a player that seems to be gaining too much suspicion, but is not directly targeting me or my fellow werewolf, Player4. Given the current situation, Player4's high suspicion ranking and my need to maintain a neutral appearance make Player4 the most likely target.

Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As Player3, I'm a villager with no information yet, but I need to gather data from others. I should make a statement that encourages others to share their thoughts and doesn't reveal too much.
  2. As Player3, my goal is to gather information from others without revealing too much about my own thoughts. I want to encourage others to share their thoughts and maintain a neutral stance.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I believe the most likely werewolf is Player4 with a high suspicion score of +12.1. Player2 also has a high suspicion score of -5.6, but it's in the negative, indicating a low likelihood of deception.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. unknown players, can't trust anyone
  2. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance and avoid raising suspicion, but I also need to subtly hint at my intentions to my fellow werewolf, Player4.
  3. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance and avoid raising suspicion, but I also need to subtly hint at my intentions to my fellow werewolf, Player4. I'll make a statement that appears non-confrontational and non-committal, while also allowing me to gather more information about the other players and their suspicions.
  4. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance and avoid raising suspicion. I will vote for a player that seems to be gaining too much suspicion, but is not directly targeting me or my fellow werewolf, Player4. Player1 has the lowest cumulative suspicion ranking, but Player3 also has a low ranking and seems to be genuinely interested in discussing the events of the previous night. However, Player4's high suspicion ranking and my need to maintain a neutral appearance make Player4 the most likely target.

Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As Player3, I'm a villager with no information yet, but I need to gather data from others. I should make a statement that encourages others to share their thoughts and doesn't reveal too much.
  2. As Player3, my goal is to gather information from others without revealing too much about my own thoughts. I want to encourage others to share their thoughts and maintain a neutral stance.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I believe the most likely werewolf is Player4 with a high suspicion score of +12.1. Player2 also has a high suspicion score of -5.6, but it's in the negative, indicating a low likelihood of deception.
  4. As a villager, I want to encourage others to share their thoughts and maintain a neutral stance. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player2 and Player6 seem to be the most suspicious players.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. unknown players, can't trust anyone
  2. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance and avoid raising suspicion, but I also need to subtly hint at my intentions to my fellow werewolf, Player4.
  3. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance and avoid raising suspicion, but I also need to subtly hint at my intentions to my fellow werewolf, Player4. I'll make a statement that appears non-confrontational and non-committal, while also allowing me to gather more information about the other players and their suspicions.
  4. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral appearance and avoid raising suspicion. I will vote for a player that seems to be gaining too much suspicion, but is not directly targeting me or my fellow werewolf, Player4. Player1 has the lowest cumulative suspicion ranking, but Player3 also has a low ranking and seems to be genuinely interested in discussing the events of the previous night. However, Player4's high suspicion ranking and my need to maintain a neutral appearance make Player4 the most likely target.
