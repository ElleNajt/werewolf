==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I need to appear as a villager to gain the trust of the other players and eliminate a potential threat. Considering the previous discussions and the suspicion rankings, I think Player6 is the most suspicious player, but voting for them might raise suspicions about my own identity. Therefore, I will vote for Player5, who is the second-most suspicious player and might be a werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -48.02]
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player6 has the highest suspicion score, indicating a high likelihood of being a werewolf. Player3 has a lower suspicion score, but still indicates a moderate likelihood of deception. As a villager, I need to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score to minimize the risk of werewolves remaining in the game. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player6.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -22.44]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, Player5 has a lower suspicion score compared to Player3, making it more likely that they are an innocent villager. Given the patterns observed with Player2's and Player4's deaths, Player3's high suspicion score suggests they may be a werewolf. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player3.
