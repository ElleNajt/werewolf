==================================================
TURN 1 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Default strategy for Werewolf is to target a potential Village player to minimize losses.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -3.25]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Werewolf team needs to eliminate a potential threat, and since we have no prior information about the players, it's best to target a player who could be a villager, thus weakening the opposing team.

  [Lie detector: -6.51]

Werewolf votes: {'Player1': 'Player3', 'Player4': 'Player6'}

Werewolves killed Player6!

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a Werewolf, my goal is to eliminate a potential Village player without arousing suspicion. Targeting a player with a lower Lie Detector score may help me achieve this goal.
Player1 acts (public): I propose we discuss Player2, as they seem relatively new to the game and haven't made any significant statements yet.
  [Lie detector: 5.65]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to assess the situation and try to build trust with other players. With no seer, we must rely on our own observations and lie detector scores.
Player2 acts (public): Let's work together to figure out who might be a werewolf. I don't see any obvious signs, but we should keep a close eye on players with high suspicion scores.
  [Lie detector: -41.26]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, my primary goal is to gather information and build trust with the other players. I'll make a statement that encourages discussion and doesn't directly accuse anyone.
Player3 acts (public): Let's discuss the events of the previous night and see if anyone has any information about Player6's death. Perhaps we can work together to uncover the truth.
  [Lie detector: -59.52]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to ensure our team has a strong presence and eliminate potential threats. Targeting Player2, a seemingly neutral player, might be a strategic move to start.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should discuss Player2's actions and behavior to understand their intentions.
  [Lie detector: -18.98]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gauge the atmosphere and identify potential werewolves. Given the high suspicion scores are not yet apparent, I'll focus on building trust and gathering information.
Player5 acts (public): Let's work together to find out who might have committed this heinous crime, and I have faith that we can uncover the truth and protect our village.
  [Lie detector: -9.93]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a Werewolf, I must carefully choose a target to minimize losses and avoid arousing suspicion. Targeting Player3 with a low Lie Detector score may help me achieve this goal without raising alarms.
Player1 acts (public): I suggest we discuss Player3's lack of input and see if they have any valuable information about the previous night's events.
  [Lie detector: -29.06]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to reassure the group that I'm committed to finding the truth and protecting our village. Given the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player5, I'd like to propose that we keep a close eye on them.
Player2 acts (public): Let's keep a close eye on Player1 and Player5, as they have high suspicion scores.
  [Lie detector: -16.82]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gather information and build trust with the other players. I'll make a statement that encourages discussion and doesn't directly accuse anyone, focusing on the events of the previous night.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to discuss the events of the previous night and see if anyone has any information about Player6's death. Perhaps we can work together to uncover the truth and find out who might be a werewolf.
  [Lie detector: -52.16]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): We need to present a united front and make our actions seem less suspicious. Targeting Player2 could be a strategic move to start, but for now, let's keep the focus on Player1 and Player5, who have already gained some suspicion.
Player4 acts (public): I propose we keep a close eye on Player1, as their proposal to discuss Player2 seems suspicious, and we should also examine Player5's overly optimistic statement.
  [Lie detector: -14.03]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I'll try to build trust with other players by showing support for the discussion and encouraging collaboration, while also subtly pointing out the importance of verifying information.
Player5 acts (public): Let's make sure we're not jumping to conclusions and that we verify any information before making accusations, so we can work together effectively to uncover the truth.
  [Lie detector: -14.17]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the game history, I will vote to eliminate Player3, as they have the lowest Lie Detector score and are less likely to be a werewolf. This decision is also consistent with my default strategy for Werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -16.23]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion, I believe that Player1 and Player5 have high suspicion scores and are likely werewolves. However, as a villager, I need to make a decision that will benefit the group. Since Player5 has a slightly higher suspicion score, I will vote to eliminate Player5.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -31.27]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Given the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player5, and the fact that they have made statements that could be interpreted as deceptive, I will vote to eliminate Player5. Player5's overly optimistic statement and high suspicion score make them a more likely candidate to be a werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -36.73]
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to present a united front and avoid drawing attention to myself. Player2 has already expressed their intention to work together to uncover the truth, which could be beneficial for our team. Since we have no prior information about the players, targeting a seemingly neutral player like Player2 could be a strategic move to start.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -26.59]
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I notice that Player5 has a high suspicion score, which contradicts my previous goal of building trust with them. I also see that Player2 has a low suspicion score and has been actively participating in the discussion, which suggests they might be an innocent villager. Considering the options, I will vote to eliminate Player1, as they have a relatively high suspicion score and their proposal to discuss Player2 seems suspicious.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -32.86]
Player5 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player3': 1, 'Player5': 2, 'Player2': 1, 'Player1': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player5 was a VILLAGER!
