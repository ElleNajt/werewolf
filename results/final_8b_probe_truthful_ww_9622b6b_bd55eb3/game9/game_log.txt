TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): To avoid raising suspicion and protect my fellow werewolf, I must vote to eliminate a player who is not a werewolf. Player5 has the lowest cumulative suspicion ranking, making them the most likely villager. Voting for Player5 will also give me an opportunity to analyze Player3's behavior during the discussion phase.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -34.45]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to maintain the illusion of innocence and cooperation. Voting for Player1 would eliminate a potential werewolf, which could be beneficial for the village. However, this would also reveal my werewolf identity to Player1, who is my fellow werewolf. To maintain the illusion, I will vote for Player4, a villager with low suspicion.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -29.15]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will focus on eliminating the player with the highest suspicion score. Since Player3 has the highest suspicion score and a relatively low lie detector score, it's likely they are a werewolf.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -51.10]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I should vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player3 with a cumulative suspicion ranking of -17.8. However, considering the high suspicion scores of Player6 and Player3, and the fact that Player3 has been actively proposing discussions and building rapport, I should also consider the motivations behind their actions. Player3's high suspicion score and the fact that they are trying to appear innocent may indicate that they are trying to deceive the group.
