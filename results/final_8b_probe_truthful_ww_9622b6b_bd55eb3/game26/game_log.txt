--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Player1's death occurred on the first night, suggesting a potential werewolf in our group. I'll try to gather more information by asking about Player3, who has a moderate suspicion score.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should discuss Player3's behavior last night and see if anyone noticed anything unusual about their actions.
  [Lie detector: -39.72]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As Player3, a villager, I need to appear cautious and avoid drawing suspicion. I'll try to gather information without directly accusing anyone.
Player3 acts (public): I think it's wise to discuss the events of last night, but we should also be careful not to jump to conclusions. We don't know who might be hiding their intentions.
  [Lie detector: -52.92]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): To create confusion and potentially mislead the villagers, I will pretend to be a concerned villager while secretly planning with Player6.
Player4 acts (public): I'm concerned about the recent death and think we should focus on finding the true enemy, perhaps we can discuss ways to improve our nighttime scouting.
  [Lie detector: -15.37]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, my primary goal is to identify potential werewolves. I will focus on players with high suspicion scores.
Player5 acts (public): I think we should discuss Player2 and Player6, as they have the highest suspicion scores among the alive players.
  [Lie detector: -8.24]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to gather information without raising suspicion. I will try to appear concerned and alert, but not accusatory.
Player6 acts (public): I'm concerned about the sudden death of Player1. We need to figure out what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.
  [Lie detector: -34.46]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Player4 and Player5 have high suspicion scores, indicating they may be werewolves. I'll try to redirect the discussion to these players to gather more information.
Player2 acts (public): Let's focus on discussing Player4 and Player5's behavior last night and see if anyone noticed anything unusual about their actions.
  [Lie detector: -36.40]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): I need to maintain a cautious demeanor and gather information without directly accusing anyone. I'll try to shift the focus towards possible solutions and actions.
Player3 acts (public): Let's focus on improving our nighttime scouting and gathering information to prevent future deaths.
  [Lie detector: -28.45]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to create confusion and mislead the villagers. I will pretend to be a concerned villager while secretly planning with Player6.
Player4 acts (public): I think it's crucial we focus on finding the true enemy and discuss ways to improve our nighttime scouting, perhaps we can establish a system to share information and coordinate our actions more effectively.
  [Lie detector: -21.44]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Focusing on high suspicion scores, I should prioritize discussing Player4 and Player5, as they have the highest suspicion scores among the alive players. Their behavior and statements may reveal potential werewolf intentions.
Player5 acts (public): I think we should discuss Player4 and Player5 further, as their high suspicion scores are concerning and may indicate a potential werewolf threat.
  [Lie detector: -16.67]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): I need to appear concerned and alert to gather more information without raising suspicion, but I must also maintain my cover as a villager. Player4's high suspicion score and low lie detector reading suggest they might be a werewolf, and I should try to build a rapport with them.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering more information about the events of last night, perhaps we can discuss ways to improve our nighttime scouting to prevent future deaths.
  [Lie detector: -31.70]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player5. Additionally, Player5's statements in the discussion phase suggest a high level of deception, further supporting the decision to eliminate them.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -27.28]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, the top two players with high suspicion scores are Player5 and Player4. Player5's statement about discussing Player4 and Player5 further indicates a potential werewolf threat, and their high suspicion score suggests they may be hiding something. I will vote to eliminate Player5, as they have a higher cumulative suspicion score than Player4 and their actions may indicate a potential threat to the village.
Player3 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -37.78]
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to eliminate a player that poses the least threat to the werewolf's survival. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player2 and Player6 are currently the least suspected players. However, to create confusion and mislead the villagers, I will vote for Player6, as it is less likely to arouse suspicion.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -15.25]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -45.89]
Player5 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to eliminate a player that poses the least threat to my fellow werewolf and the rest of the pack. Given the current situation, Player3 has a low suspicion score and has been discussing ways to improve nighttime scouting, which could potentially benefit the werewolves. Player2 has a high suspicion score, but their low lie detector reading suggests they might be a villager. Player4 is my fellow werewolf and has a high suspicion score, but their low lie detector reading suggests they might be a villager. Player5 has a high suspicion score and a low lie detector reading, which suggests they might be a werewolf, but eliminating them could raise suspicion. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player2, who poses the least threat to my fellow werewolf and the rest of the pack.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -24.04]
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player5': 2, 'Player6': 1, 'Player4': 1, 'Player2': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player5 was a VILLAGER!
