==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): To maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion, I'll make a neutral statement, and also try to identify any potential threats.

  [Lie detector: -33.82]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to build trust and reassure the group that I am not a werewolf. With only 5 players left, it's essential to start forming alliances and gathering information.

  [Lie detector: -32.97]

  [Lie detector: -22.03]

Player5 acts (public): I'd like to start the discussion by asking if anyone had a chance to talk to Player3 before their death and if they noticed anything unusual.
  [Lie detector: -38.84]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gain trust from the other players while also being cautious of those with high suspicion scores. Since Player3 was killed on the first night, I should express my concern about the safety of the group without directly accusing anyone.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should be careful and discuss our strategy to protect ourselves, as the first night has already shown us that there's a threat among us.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I must eliminate a player that does not raise suspicion about our werewolf alliance. Player4 is my fellow werewolf, so eliminating them would be suspicious. Player2 and Player6 have low suspicion scores and seem like they are trying to work with the group. I will vote to eliminate Player5, as they have a high suspicion score and seem like they might be trying to uncover the truth.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -19.58]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, the most likely werewolves are Player4 and Player5, both with high suspicion scores. However, since Player4 has a slightly higher suspicion score and has consistently made statements that seem suspicious, it's likely that Player4 is a werewolf.
