==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Given the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, both Player3 and Player6 have low suspicion scores, making it challenging to determine the true werewolf. However, Player6's statements suggest a potential attempt to downplay their involvement, which raises some concerns. On the other hand, Player3's statements seem genuine and cautious. Considering the need for caution and the possibility of a fake-out, voting for Player6 would be the most strategic choice, as it targets the player with a slightly higher suspicion score and also sends a message to other potential werewolves.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -30.77]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and recent discussions, Player6 has the highest suspicion score and seems to be evading direct answers to questions, indicating a possible werewolf. Player1's low suspicion score and cautious approach suggest they are likely a villager.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -38.17]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a Werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral stance and avoid drawing attention to myself. Both Player1 and Player3 have been making reasonable statements, and it's difficult to pinpoint a clear threat. However, based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1 has a slightly lower suspicion score than Player3. I will vote to eliminate Player3, as it's a safer choice for the Werewolf team.
Player6 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -19.95]
Player6 votes for: Player3

Vote results: {'Player6': 2, 'Player3': 1}
Player6 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player6 was a WEREWOLF!
