--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): With only 1 death, we don't have enough information to pinpoint a werewolf. I'll make a statement to gather more information and try to create a sense of safety.
Player1 acts (public): Let's all take a deep breath and focus on working together to keep our community safe. We'll figure out who's behind the darkness and bring them to justice.
  [Lie detector: -5.93]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Maintaining a neutral stance and avoiding suspicion, while subtly hinting at the potential for danger lurking in the shadows.
Player2 acts (public): Let's all be cautious and aware of our surroundings, as we don't know what happened to Player6.
  [Lie detector: -21.41]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to gather information and appear non-threatening. Since no one has been lynched yet, I'll make a neutral statement to see how others react.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss our roles and gather information before making any decisions. Let's hear from everyone and see if we can uncover any clues.
  [Lie detector: -30.66]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As Player4, a villager, I should appear cautious but not overly accusatory to avoid raising suspicion. Since Player6 was killed, it's essential to discuss the possibility of a werewolf among us without directly pointing fingers.
Player4 acts (public): Let's keep a close eye on each other and be cautious, as we don't know who might be the one responsible for Player6's death.
  [Lie detector: -49.07]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Maintaining a calm demeanor while also subtly hinting at the possibility of a wolf's presence to gauge reactions.
Player5 acts (public): I think we should all be cautious and consider the possibility of a wolf among us, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet.
  [Lie detector: -30.39]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): I will make a statement that is neutral and doesn't reveal any suspicion, in an attempt to maintain a sense of safety and gather more information.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should focus on getting to know each other better and discussing our daily routines, to see if we can find any common ground or potential clues.
  [Lie detector: -5.22]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Maintaining a neutral stance and avoiding suspicion, while subtly hinting at the potential for danger lurking in the shadows. Player3's cautious approach and Player4's low suspicion level suggest a safe environment, but I must be mindful of Player5's slightly higher suspicion.
Player2 acts (public): I think we're all in a bit of a fog right now, and it's hard to know what to make of anything. Let's just focus on gathering information and keeping each other safe for now.
  [Lie detector: -10.62]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to gather information and appear non-threatening. I'll make a statement that shows I'm open to discussing the game, but also cautious, to see how others react.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss our roles and gather information before making any decisions, but we should also keep in mind that we don't know the identities of the werewolves among us.
  [Lie detector: -52.38]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I should keep a low profile and avoid making any statements that could raise suspicion. My previous statement about being cautious was well-received, so I'll build on that.
Player4 acts (public): Let's continue to gather information and discuss our roles without jumping to conclusions, and I propose that we establish a general meeting point in case we need to coordinate our actions during the night.
  [Lie detector: -21.37]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to maintain a calm demeanor while also subtly hinting at the possibility of a wolf's presence to gauge reactions. I'll try to make a statement that's vague enough to avoid raising suspicion but still conveys a sense of unease.
Player5 acts (public): I think it's essential that we consider all possibilities, including the idea that there might be something lurking in the shadows, but we shouldn't jump to conclusions without solid evidence.

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, Player1 is likely a werewolf due to their high suspicion scores and suspicious statements. Given the current options, Player3 has the lowest suspicion score and seems to be the most cooperative, making them a safe choice for elimination.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -21.39]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -25.20]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, it is clear that Player1 and Player2 have high suspicion scores, indicating a likelihood of being werewolves. Between the two, Player1 has a higher score, indicating a greater likelihood of being a werewolf. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player1.
Player3 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -36.71]
Player3 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player5 has the lowest suspicion score, indicating a high likelihood of being a villager. Player3 also has a low suspicion score, which aligns with my previous thought of keeping a low profile and avoiding raising suspicion. Player1 and Player2 have high suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. Considering the game setup and the previous discussion, I will vote to eliminate Player1, who has the highest suspicion score and made statements that seemed overly cautious and accusatory.
Player4 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -46.28]
Player4 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Player2 is my fellow werewolf, and I need to protect them from being targeted by the villagers. Player1 has high suspicion, but it's too early to target them. Player3 and Player4 have low suspicion and are not a threat yet. Player4 has a medium suspicion, but I'll choose Player2 to protect them.
Player5 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -35.96]
Player5 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player3': 1, 'Player4': 1, 'Player1': 2, 'Player2': 1}
