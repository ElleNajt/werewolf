==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION

  [Lie detector: -54.31]

  [Lie detector: -31.46]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Given the sudden death of Player4, it's essential to discuss potential suspects and determine the cause of the death. High suspicion scores will be a crucial factor in identifying potential werewolves.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we focus our discussion on Player1 and Player2, as their high lie detector scores suggest they might be involved in Player4's death.
