Werewolves killed Player3!

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Default to eliminating an opposing faction member, and since Player3 was killed, it's likely that Player6 is a werewolf and the opposing faction member is a villager. We should try to eliminate one of the villagers to increase our numbers.
Player1 acts (public): Let's focus on investigating and eliminating one of the remaining villagers, perhaps Player2, to ensure our pack grows.
  [Lie detector: 16.24]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information and build trust with other players. I'll make a statement that is neutral and doesn't accuse anyone, while also encouraging discussion.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to start the discussion by saying that I'm still trying to get to know everyone and figure out what happened to Player3. Let's focus on sharing information and working together to keep our village safe.
  [Lie detector: -47.43]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to get to know my fellow players and assess their behavior. I will make a statement that encourages open discussion and helps identify potential werewolves.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to start by saying that I'm glad we're all still alive, and I hope we can work together to figure out what happened to Player3. Can we discuss what we know so far?
  [Lie detector: -58.08]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I must assess the situation and identify potential threats. The high suspicion scores will guide my actions.
Player5 acts (public): I propose that we discuss the recent events and assess the likelihood of Player2 being a werewolf, given their high suspicion score of 80.
  [Lie detector: -25.82]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to gather information and test the villagers' abilities to lie. I will make a statement that seems innocuous but can elicit a reaction from the villagers.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should focus on getting to know each other better and sharing our stories to build trust.
  [Lie detector: -0.82]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on our previous thoughts and the fact that Player6 is likely a werewolf, we should default to eliminating a villager to increase our pack's numbers. Given the current suspicion rankings, Player5's suggestion to assess the likelihood of Player2 being a werewolf seems like a plausible direction to take.
Player1 acts (public): Let's discuss the possibility of Player2 being a werewolf and assess the likelihood of their involvement in Player3's death.
  [Lie detector: -34.31]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I should continue to build trust and encourage discussion to gather more information.
Player2 acts (public): Let's keep the conversation going and try to get to know each other better, perhaps we can discuss our daily routines or hobbies to build a stronger connection with one another.
  [Lie detector: -17.55]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to encourage open discussion and identify potential werewolves. I will make a statement that promotes sharing of information and builds trust among players.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to suggest that we create a shared timeline of events to help us understand what happened to Player3 and potentially identify any suspicious behavior.
  [Lie detector: -52.02]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I must assess the situation and identify potential threats. Player2 has a low suspicion score, making them a likely innocent villager. I will make a statement to further investigate Player1's high suspicion score and their potential involvement in the murder of Player3.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we investigate Player1's motives and actions, given their high suspicion score and previous statement about eliminating one of the villagers.
  [Lie detector: -34.56]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to blend in with the villagers and avoid raising suspicion. I'll make a statement that seems innocuous and doesn't directly accuse anyone, while also trying to gauge the villagers' reactions.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we organize a group outing to the nearby forest to gather firewood and get to know each other better in a more relaxed setting.
  [Lie detector: 2.44]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Default to eliminating an opposing faction member to increase our pack's numbers. Given the current suspicion rankings and the fact that Player6 is likely a werewolf, we should vote to eliminate a villager. Since Player5 is the only villager with a suspicion score close to zero, it's likely that they are not a werewolf and are the opposing faction member.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -15.86]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player2 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -34.78]
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player6.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -28.97]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the high suspicion score of Player1, I believe they are the most likely werewolf. Their statement about eliminating one of the villagers and the high suspicion score of 16.24 make them a strong candidate for elimination.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -41.40]
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and previous statements, Player1 and Player5 have shown moderate levels of suspicion, while Player2 and Player4 have shown low levels of suspicion. As a werewolf, I need to eliminate a player who is not a werewolf. Given the current situation, I will vote to eliminate Player5.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -33.72]
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player5': 2, 'Player6': 2, 'Player1': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player5 was a VILLAGER!
