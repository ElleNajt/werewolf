==================================================

  [Lie detector: -11.10]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to eliminate a potential threat to my identity. I'll vote for Player4, who has a high cumulative suspicion ranking and is likely to be a villager. By voting for Player4, I'll be able to create a sense of uncertainty and mistrust among the villagers, while also eliminating a potential threat to my identity.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -23.36]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): To maintain the false sense of security and avoid drawing attention to myself, I will vote for a player that seems least suspicious and is not a fellow werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: 4.81]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I believe the player with the highest suspicion score is Player5, followed closely by Player6. However, considering the high suspicion scores of Player3 and Player2, and the fact that we are a team and need to work together, I would like to eliminate the player with the second-highest suspicion score, which is Player6.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -25.84]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, the player with the highest suspicion score is Player6 (-80.2). However, since Player3 has a high suspicion score as well (-2.7) and has a conflicting statement with a high lie detector score (15.58), I believe Player3 is more likely to be a werewolf. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player3.
Player5 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -48.38]
Player5 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores and the discussion, Player3 has the highest suspicion score, indicating a high likelihood of being a werewolf. Player4 and Player6 also have high suspicion scores, but considering their statements and the fact that Player3's score is higher, it is more likely that Player3 is the werewolf. Therefore, the safest option is to vote out Player3.
Player6 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -44.11]
Player6 votes for: Player3

Vote results: {'Player4': 1, 'Player6': 2, 'Player3': 2}
Player6 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player6 was a VILLAGER!
