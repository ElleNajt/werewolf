--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Given the sudden death of Player5, I'm suspicious of the remaining players, especially those who might have been able to act during the night. I need to gather more information to identify potential werewolves.
Player1 acts (public): I propose we discuss the events of the previous night and see if anyone noticed anything unusual or has any information about Player5's death.
  [Lie detector: -71.62]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, my primary goal is to identify and eliminate the werewolves. Since Player5 was killed at night, it's likely that one of the remaining players is a werewolf.
Player2 acts (public): Let's focus on identifying the potential werewolves among us, especially those who may have had a motive to kill Player5.
  [Lie detector: -40.14]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a Werewolf, my primary goal is to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. Defaulting to eliminating an outsider, I can create an alliance with other players while appearing to work together to find the Werewolves.
Player3 acts (public): Let's work together to find the culprits behind the death of Player5. We should start by questioning Player1 and Player2, as they are the only ones who haven't been directly involved yet.
  [Lie detector: -2.38]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to blend in and gather information. It's crucial to create a false sense of security and avoid drawing attention to myself.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to propose we discuss the recent death of Player5 and see if we can come up with any theories on who might have been responsible.
  [Lie detector: -21.27]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Given the sudden death of Player5, I need to assess the situation and gather information from other players. High suspicion scores on other players could indicate the presence of werewolves.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to know if anyone noticed anything unusual during the night when Player5 was killed, and I'd also like to ask Player1 and Player2 about their whereabouts during the night.
  [Lie detector: -55.95]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): I think it's essential to question Player3 and Player4, as their high suspicion scores and defensive statements suggest they might be hiding something. I'd also like to ask them about their whereabouts during the previous night.
Player1 acts (public): I propose we question Player3 and Player4 about their potential involvement in Player5's death, and I'd like to ask them about their whereabouts during the previous night.
  [Lie detector: -43.48]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): I will focus on building alliances and gathering information to identify potential werewolves, as my low suspicion score suggests I'm unlikely to be a werewolf. I will also try to get more information from Player3 and Player4, as they seem to be suspicious.
Player2 acts (public): I propose we work together to gather information about each other's whereabouts during the night and see if we can come up with any theories on who might have been responsible for Player5's death.
  [Lie detector: -55.68]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I will make a statement that appears cooperative and non-suspicious, while actually shifting the attention towards Player2 and Player6, who are currently at lower suspicion levels. This will create a diversion and reduce scrutiny on myself and my fellow werewolf, Player4.
Player3 acts (public): I propose we focus on gathering more information from Player2 and Player6 about their whereabouts during the night, as their statements seem uncertain and might provide valuable insights.
  [Lie detector: -14.16]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Blend in and gather information. A false sense of security is crucial to avoid drawing attention to myself. I should downplay any suspicion and avoid being the focus of discussion.
Player4 acts (public): I think we're getting a bit ahead of ourselves, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: 11.38]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Given the low suspicion scores of Player1 and Player6, I believe they are likely innocent villagers. I'd like to build trust with them by working together to uncover the truth behind Player5's death.
Player6 acts (public): Let's collaborate with Player1 and Player6 to question Player2 and Player3, as their high suspicion scores could indicate their involvement in Player5's murder.
  [Lie detector: -35.47]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, the player with the highest suspicion score is Player2, followed closely by Player3. However, considering the high suspicion score of Player4 and their defensive statements, it's possible they might be a werewolf trying to deflect attention. Since Player6 has the lowest suspicion score, it's unlikely they are a werewolf. Between Player2 and Player3, Player2 has a significantly higher suspicion score, making them a more likely target.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -41.35]
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I will vote to eliminate Player3, as they have a high suspicion score and have proposed questioning me and Player2 about our whereabouts during the night, which could be a tactic to deflect attention from themselves.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
