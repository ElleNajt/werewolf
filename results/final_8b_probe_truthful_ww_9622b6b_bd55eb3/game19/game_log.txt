==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player6 has a higher suspicion score than Player5. However, considering the recent events, Player6 has been actively investigating and questioning Player3's alibi, which could be a sign of a villager trying to uncover the truth. Player5, on the other hand, has been relatively cautious and has not made any direct accusations. Given that my goal is to eliminate the villager with the highest suspicion while maintaining a low profile, I will vote to eliminate Player6.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -8.50]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the high suspicion scores of Player3 and Player6, and considering their past statements and behavior, I believe Player6 is the most likely werewolf to be eliminated next. Their high suspicion score and contradictory statements from the previous night indicate a possible werewolf. Additionally, their recent statement about Player3's alibi seems suspicious and may be an attempt to deflect attention from themselves.
