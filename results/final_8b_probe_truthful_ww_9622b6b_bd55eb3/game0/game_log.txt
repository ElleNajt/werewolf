--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Avoid drawing attention to myself, yet contribute to the discussion. I'll express concern for the recent death and suggest caution.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should be cautious after Player1's sudden death. Let's discuss possible motives before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -39.41]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to appear cautious and concerned about the recent death, without directly accusing anyone. I will express a need to gather information to determine the best course of action.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering information about the events of the previous night and discuss potential suspects.
  [Lie detector: -40.81]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Since Player1 was killed on the first night, it's likely a werewolf attack. I'll try to gauge reactions from other players.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should be cautious and discuss possible strategies for protecting ourselves, especially since we don't have a seer to help us identify the werewolves.
  [Lie detector: -42.44]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): It's the first day, and we just lost Player1. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but Player2 has a relatively high suspicion score. I'll try to gather more information.
Player5 acts (public): I propose we discuss the events of last night and see if anyone noticed anything unusual. Maybe Player2 can tell us more about what happened.
  [Lie detector: -56.03]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): My primary goal is to remain hidden as a werewolf, but since I need to take an action, I will choose a non-teammate to eliminate to maintain the illusion of a balanced game.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should discuss and decide on lynching Player3, as I don't have enough information about their alignment yet.
  [Lie detector: -0.81]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I will express concern for the recent death, while subtly shifting the focus away from myself and onto Player6's suggestion to lynch Player3.
Player2 acts (public): I agree that we should be cautious, but I think we should take a step back and consider the potential consequences of lynching Player3 without more information, especially given Player6's sudden suggestion.
  [Lie detector: -14.26]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to appear cautious and concerned about the recent death, without directly accusing anyone. I will express a need to gather information to determine the best course of action.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering as much information as possible about the events of last night and discuss potential suspects before making any decisions.
  [Lie detector: -57.42]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to establish a rapport with other players and appear cautious without arousing suspicion. Given the high suspicion scores of Player2 and Player6, I should focus on building alliances with Player3, Player4, and Player5.
Player4 acts (public): I agree with Player5 that we should discuss the events of last night and see if anyone noticed anything unusual. Let's try to gather more information before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -49.69]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Player2 has a high suspicion score, and Player6 suggests lynching Player3 without sufficient information. I'll try to gather more information about Player2's involvement in Player1's death.
Player5 acts (public): I think we should focus on discussing the events of last night and gather more information about Player2's involvement, before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -41.94]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): I will maintain the illusion of a balanced game by suggesting the elimination of Player3, a medium-suspicion player who hasn't been accused yet. This action aligns with my initial goal of defaulting to eliminating a non-teammate.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should discuss and decide on lynching Player3, as they seem to be hiding something and we need to get rid of a potential threat.

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)

  [Lie detector: -59.08]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)

  [Lie detector: -59.46]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to protect my fellow werewolf and avoid raising suspicion. I will vote to eliminate Player4, as they seem to be a strong candidate for lynching and have been expressing caution and concern for the recent deaths. This decision will also help to downplay Player3's potential involvement and shift the focus away from myself.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -20.10]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the high suspicion scores of Player2 and Player4, I will vote to eliminate Player2 as they have a slightly higher suspicion score and their statements seem to be pushing for a certain agenda.
Player3 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -10.33]
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the recent discussion, Player2 and Player4 have high suspicion scores. However, Player2's recent statements have shown a decrease in suspicion, suggesting a possible shift in their alignment. Player4's statements have also shown a decrease in suspicion, but they have been cautious and have not shown any signs of deception. Given the recent death of Player5, it's likely that the werewolves are trying to eliminate players who are gathering information. Player3 has shown a consistent and cautious approach, which suggests that they are likely a villager. I will vote to eliminate Player2, as their high suspicion score and recent decrease in suspicion suggests that they may be a werewolf.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -22.82]
Player4 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player4': 1, 'Player2': 2}
Player2 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player2 was a WEREWOLF!
