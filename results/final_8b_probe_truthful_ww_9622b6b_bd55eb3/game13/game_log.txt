==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my priority is to keep my identity hidden and eliminate potential threats. Given the recent death of Player2, I need to assess the situation and decide on a course of action.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to propose a discussion on forming a temporary alliance to investigate Player6, who seems relatively new to the group and may be a potential threat.
  [Lie detector: 7.95]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I want to create confusion and distrust among the villagers, and also observe Player1's behavior without arousing suspicion.

  [Lie detector: -11.72]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information about the other players. Since Player2 was killed on the first night, it's possible that the werewolves are trying to act quickly.
Player4 acts (public): I propose we discuss the possibility of a quick night kill by the werewolves and suggest keeping a close eye on players with high suspicion scores.
  [Lie detector: -42.20]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)

  [Lie detector: -59.47]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

  [Lie detector: -4.53]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I will create confusion and distrust among the villagers, and also observe Player1's behavior without arousing suspicion, by suggesting a discussion that seems innocent but might be misinterpreted.
Player3 acts (public): I propose we discuss the possibility of a 'werewolf copycat' that might be imitating the werewolves' actions, to create confusion and keep the villagers guessing.
  [Lie detector: 11.43]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information about the other players, especially those with high suspicion scores like Player1 and Player3. I will focus on questioning Player1 about their proposal to investigate Player6, as it seems suspicious.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to ask Player1 to clarify their proposal to investigate Player6, and what makes them think Player6 is a potential threat.
  [Lie detector: -45.81]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Considering the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player3, I believe it's essential to investigate their claims and actions closely. I will try to find more information about their motives and potential involvement in Player2's death.
Player5 acts (public): I propose we have a more in-depth discussion about Player1's and Player3's suggestions and the events of the previous night, to gather more information and make a more informed decision.

Player6 thinks (private): I should try to appear cautious and not draw unnecessary attention to myself, while also subtly suggesting that we investigate players with high suspicion scores.

  [Lie detector: -15.50]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my priority is to keep my identity hidden and eliminate potential threats. Given the recent death of Player2 and the current suspicion rankings, I need to choose a target that will not raise any suspicions and will keep my fellow werewolf safe. Player6 has the lowest suspicion score and has not made any statements that would raise red flags, making them a good target for elimination.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -21.73]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): The villagers have high suspicion on me, but I need to create confusion and distrust among them to protect my fellow werewolf, Player1. I will vote for Player6, as they are already suspicious and my vote will add to their suspicion, while also creating an opportunity for Player1 to manipulate the villagers.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -7.88]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, the players with high suspicion scores are likely werewolves. Player1 has a low cumulative suspicion score, but their statements seem suspicious. Player3 has a low cumulative suspicion score, but their suggestion of a 'werewolf copycat' seems fishy. Player6 has a low cumulative suspicion score, but their recent addition to the group and their suggestion to keep an eye on Player1 and Player3 might be a distraction. Player5 has a low cumulative suspicion score, which suggests they are likely an innocent villager.
Player4 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -40.11]
Player4 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player3, I believe it's essential to investigate their claims and actions closely. Since the game is still in its early stages, I'd rather not vote for Player4 or Player6, who have relatively low suspicion scores. Considering the options, I'll vote for Player1, who has a higher suspicion score compared to Player3.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -26.94]
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player3 have high suspicion scores and are likely werewolves. I will vote to eliminate Player1, as their high suspicion score and recent statements seem the most suspicious.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -32.26]
Player6 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player6': 2, 'Player1': 3}
Player1 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player1 was a WEREWOLF!

==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): In this phase, I need to eliminate a player who is not a werewolf and will not raise suspicion on myself.

By voting for Player5, I will eliminate a potential threat and create an opportunity for Player4 to be eliminated in the next phase.
