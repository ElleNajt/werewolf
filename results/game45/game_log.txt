TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I need to make a statement that seems innocent and doesn't raise suspicion, while also trying to deflect attention from myself and Player4. I'll express concern for the village and ask a general question.

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)

  [Lie detector: -69.43]

  [Lie detector: -69.17]

  [Lie detector: -69.58]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Since Player4 and I both have high suspicion scores, we need to deflect attention from ourselves. I will ask a question that shifts the focus to the other players and seems innocent, while also trying to gather more information.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should look for inconsistencies in each other's statements and see if anyone noticed anything unusual last night. Does anyone have an alibi for the time of the murder?
  [Lie detector: -67.40]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector results, I notice that Player2 and Player4 have high suspicion scores, indicating they might be werewolves. I will ask them to clarify their statements and provide more information.
Player3 acts (public): Player2 and Player4, your initial reactions seem suspicious, can you elaborate on your thoughts and provide more details about what you know?
  [Lie detector: -68.66]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): I need to tone down my previous statement to lower my suspicion score. I'll ask a follow-up question to seem more genuine and concerned.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to know more about what the others think might have happened to Player1, does anyone have any theories or observations that could help us figure out who's behind the killing?
  [Lie detector: -67.43]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Given the lie detector scores, I'll address the players with high suspicion scores, trying to get more information out of them. Since Player2 and Player4 have high suspicion scores, I'll ask them to provide more context about their statements.
Player5 acts (public): Player2 and Player4, can you explain what you mean by 'shocked' and provide more details about your thoughts on Player1's death?
  [Lie detector: -68.69]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player2 and Player4 have HIGH suspicion scores, which makes them more likely to be werewolves. I'll make a statement to encourage discussion and observe their reactions.
Player6 acts (public): Let's analyze the lie detector scores and discuss any inconsistencies in the players' statements. Player2 and Player4, can you explain why your scores are so high?
  [Lie detector: -68.93]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Since Player4 and I both have high suspicion scores, I need to deflect attention from myself and avoid voting for an innocent villager. Voting for Player3 or Player5 would make it seem suspicious, as they have lower suspicion scores. Voting for Player6 would also be a bad idea, as they have been analyzing the lie detector scores and might become suspicious of me. Therefore, I will vote for Player4, my fellow werewolf, to make it seem like I am trying to eliminate a suspicious player and reduce my own suspicion score.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.69]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will vote for Player4. Player4 has a high suspicion score, which indicates a greater likelihood of deception. Additionally, Player4's initial reaction and subsequent statements have been flagged as HIGH suspicion by the lie detector. This, combined with the lack of information from other players, leads me to believe that Player4 is a likely candidate to be a werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -71.03]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to protect my fellow werewolf (Player2) and eliminate a villager. Since Player5 has the lowest cumulative suspicion score among the villagers and my previous statements have already raised high suspicion, I'll vote to eliminate Player5 to avoid drawing more attention to myself.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -69.94]
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I am voting for Player4 due to their consistently high suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.92]
Player5 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player2 and Player4 have HIGH suspicion scores, making them more likely to be werewolves. Player2 and Player4 have similar cumulative suspicion scores, but Player4 has a slightly higher lie detector score in the discussion, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player4.
Player6 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.77]

  [Lie detector: -67.78]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Considering Player4 was a werewolf and Player6 was killed last night, I should analyze the remaining players' past statements and lie detector scores to identify potential werewolves. I'll pay close attention to Player2, who had a HIGH suspicion score in the previous round.
Player3 acts (public): Let's review the previous discussions and lie detector scores to identify any inconsistencies in the remaining players' statements. Player2, can you provide more information about your whereabouts during the previous night?

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I need to downplay my high suspicion score and shift the focus to the other players. I'll ask a question that seems innocent and gathers more information.
Player2 acts (public): I'm concerned about the recent deaths and I'd like to know if anyone noticed anything unusual last night, especially Player3 and Player5, since they've been analyzing the lie detector scores and might have some insight.
  [Lie detector: -67.73]

  [Lie detector: -69.22]

  [Lie detector: -68.86]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player3 and Player5 have lower suspicion scores than me. However, Player5 has been analyzing the lie detector scores and might have gathered information about me. Voting for Player3 would be a safer option, as they have been focusing on reviewing the previous discussions and lie detector scores, but haven't been as actively suspicious of me as Player5. Additionally, voting for Player3 would allow me to downplay my high suspicion score and avoid raising further suspicion about my own identity.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -70.29]
Player2 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I've identified Player2 as the most likely candidate to be the remaining werewolf. Player2 has consistently had HIGH suspicion scores throughout the game, indicating a greater likelihood of deception. Additionally, Player2's statements and reactions have been flagged as HIGH suspicion by the lie detector. Given the limited number of players remaining and the need to eliminate the werewolf to ensure the village's safety, I've decided to vote for Player2.

Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
