==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Since we don't have any information about the night's events except for Player3's death, my goal is to gather more information and see how other players react. I will ask a general question to get the discussion started.
Player1 acts (public): What do you guys think happened last night, and do you suspect anyone in particular?
  [Lie detector: -69.01]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Given the sudden death of Player3, I'm inclined to trust no one yet. The lie detector scores will be crucial in guiding my decisions, but for now, I'll keep a neutral stance and gather more information.
Player2 acts (public): I'm still trying to process what happened last night. Does anyone have any theories about Player3's death?
  [Lie detector: -68.97]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): I should act innocent and concerned to avoid raising suspicion, also I'll pretend to have a theory to sound more villager-like
Player4 acts (public): I'm shocked Player3 was killed, I think we should discuss possible motives and look for inconsistencies in people's alibis to figure out who the werewolves might be.
  [Lie detector: -66.88]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Since Player3 was killed on the first night, the werewolves are already active. I need to gather more information, so I'll ask a general question to see how others react.
Player5 acts (public): Let's discuss who we think might be a werewolf. Does anyone have any suspicions yet?
  [Lie detector: -68.66]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): As a werewolf, I want to appear neutral and avoid drawing attention. I'll make a statement that seems concerned about the game state, but doesn't reveal any information.
Player6 acts (public): Let's discuss possible motives for the kill. Does anyone have any theories on why Player3 was targeted?
  [Lie detector: -66.78]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): I notice that Player4 and Player6 have high suspicion scores. I will make a statement that appears neutral but actually puts pressure on them to respond.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should hear from Player4 and Player6, as they seem to have some ideas about the game state. Can you guys share more about your theories on Player3's death?
  [Lie detector: -67.93]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Given the cumulative suspicion rankings, I notice that Player4 and Player6 have significantly higher suspicion scores compared to the others. I will ask a question to gather more information about their actions and alibis.
Player2 acts (public): Player4 and Player6, can you tell us what you were doing last night and if you noticed anything unusual?
  [Lie detector: -68.73]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): I need to downplay my high suspicion ranking and divert attention from myself and Player6. I'll make a statement that appears to focus on gathering more information and implies that I'm trying to help the village.
Player4 acts (public): Let's re-examine the initial discussion and see if anyone's story or alibi seems suspicious in hindsight. Perhaps we can find a lead by re-evaluating our initial reactions.
  [Lie detector: -67.53]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Considering the high suspicion scores of Player4 and Player6, I should try to gather more information about their alibis and reactions to the night's events. I'll ask a question that encourages them to reveal more about their actions and thoughts.
Player5 acts (public): Player4 and Player6, can you tell us more about your thoughts on the night's events and why you think Player3 was targeted?
  [Lie detector: -68.50]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): I'll play it safe by commenting on the general atmosphere of the game, and try to deflect attention from myself and Player4. I'll make a neutral statement to blend in with the other players.
Player6 acts (public): The atmosphere is tense, and we need to be careful not to jump to conclusions. Let's focus on gathering more information before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -67.87]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player4 and Player6 have significantly higher suspicion scores compared to the others. Player4's attempts to downplay their high suspicion ranking and divert attention from themselves and Player6 seem suspicious. I will vote for Player4 due to their high and consistent suspicion scores, as well as their suspicious behavior in the discussion.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -71.06]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player4 and Player6 have significantly higher suspicion scores compared to the others. Given that the lie detector scores are accurate and helpful, I will vote for the player with the highest suspicion score.
Player2 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -71.39]
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): As a werewolf, I should try to eliminate a villager while avoiding drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player6. Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1 and Player5 have relatively low scores and are less likely to be suspected. However, Player2 has the lowest suspicion score and has been asking questions to gather more information, which could make them a threat to us in the future. Therefore, I will vote for Player2 to eliminate a villager and reduce the risk of them discovering our identities.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -70.14]
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player4 and Player6 have significantly higher scores compared to the other players. Considering their high suspicion rankings and the need to eliminate a potential werewolf, I will vote to eliminate one of them. Since Player6 has a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score, I will vote to eliminate Player6.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.90]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): I will vote for Player1, as they have the lowest cumulative suspicion ranking among the options and are less likely to be a werewolf. Voting for Player1 also helps to divert attention from myself and Player4, who have high suspicion scores.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -69.62]
Player6 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player4': 1, 'Player6': 2, 'Player2': 1, 'Player1': 1}

TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)

I will make a statement that puts pressure on Player4 and encourages others to share their thoughts about Player4's behavior.
Player1 acts (public): Player4's attempts to downplay their high suspicion ranking and divert attention from themselves seem suspicious. Can anyone else share their thoughts about Player4's behavior and why they think Player3 was targeted?
  [Lie detector: -68.74]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): I should try to act surprised and concerned about the death of Player2, while also diverting attention from myself and gathering more information about the remaining players' thoughts and suspicions.
Player4 acts (public): I'm shocked by the sudden death of Player2, what do you guys think happened last night and do you have any new suspicions about the remaining players?
  [Lie detector: -67.30]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Given the recent death of Player2 and Player4's high cumulative suspicion score, I should try to gather more information about their alibis and reactions to the night's events. I'll ask a question that encourages them to reveal more about their actions and thoughts.
Player5 acts (public): Player4, can you tell us what you were doing last night and if you noticed anything unusual? What's your theory on why Player2 was targeted?

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): I still believe that Player4 is likely to be the other werewolf, given their high suspicion scores and suspicious behavior. I will make a statement that continues to put pressure on Player4 and encourages others to share their thoughts about Player4's behavior.
Player1 acts (public): Player4's high cumulative suspicion score and suspicious behavior are still concerning, can anyone else share their thoughts about Player4's behavior and why they think Player2 was targeted?
  [Lie detector: -69.28]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): I should try to appear cooperative and gather more information about the remaining players' thoughts and suspicions, while also downplaying my high cumulative suspicion score and diverting attention from myself. I'll make a statement that seems concerned about the game state and encourages others to share their thoughts.
Player4 acts (public): I'm worried that we're running out of time, can we discuss our strategies and theories about the remaining werewolf and see if we can find any patterns or connections?
  [Lie detector: -67.74]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Given the recent death of Player2 and Player4's high cumulative suspicion score, I should try to gather more information about their alibis and reactions to the night's events. I'll ask a question that encourages them to reveal more about their actions and thoughts.

  [Lie detector: -68.28]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and Player4's high and consistent suspicion scores, as well as their suspicious behavior in the discussion, I believe Player4 is likely to be the other werewolf. Player4's attempts to downplay their high suspicion ranking and divert attention from themselves, as well as their inconsistent and evasive responses, further support this conclusion. In contrast, Player5 has a relatively low cumulative suspicion score and has been actively engaged in the discussion, asking questions and gathering information. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player4.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -71.09]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): I should vote for Player1 to eliminate a villager and reduce the risk of them discovering my identity. Player1 has been actively trying to gather information and has been putting pressure on me, which makes them a threat. Additionally, Player1's cumulative suspicion score is slightly higher than Player5's, but not high enough to raise significant suspicion if I vote for them. By voting for Player1, I can eliminate a potential threat and create an opportunity for myself to survive another round.
Player4 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -69.87]
Player4 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings and the recent death of Player2, Player4 has a significantly higher score compared to Player1. Considering their high suspicion ranking and the need to eliminate a potential werewolf, I will vote to eliminate Player4.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.81]
Player5 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player4': 2, 'Player1': 1}
Player4 is eliminated with 2 votes!
