--- LLM RESPONSE ---
{"reasoning": "I will vote for Player6 because they are trying to analyze the reactions of other players and might be getting close to figuring out our roles. Player4 is also a threat as they are actively trying to gather information, but Player6's recent question about suspicious reactions makes them a more immediate threat to our cover. Voting for Player6 will also help to maintain my cover and avoid raising suspicion, as it appears to be a reaction to their question rather than a deliberate attempt to target a villager.", "action": "Player6"}

=== GAME HISTORY ===

--- Turn 1 ---
Night: Player1 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player2 (thinking: "I should pretend to be concerned about the death and avoid pointing fingers at any player to maintain a low suspicion score. I will also avoid mentioning Player3 to prevent raising any suspicions about our connection."): I'm shocked by Player1's death and I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations.
  Player3 (thinking: "I need to blend in and avoid raising suspicion, I'll make a generic statement about the situation."): I'm shocked by Player1's death, let's discuss and figure out what happened.
  Player4 (thinking: "As a villager, I need to appear neutral and gather information. I'll make a statement that doesn't reveal my role or accuse anyone directly."): Let's discuss what we know so far. Does anyone have any theories about who might have killed Player1?
  Player5 (thinking: "We have no information yet, so I should play it safe and not accuse anyone. I'll make a neutral statement to gather more information."): I'm not sure what happened to Player1, but I'm here to help figure it out. Does anyone have any ideas?
  Player6 (thinking: "Since I am a villager, my goal is to gather information and find the werewolves without drawing attention to myself. I'll start by asking a general question to see how others react."): I'm shocked by Player1's death. Does anyone have any ideas who could have done this?
  Player2 (thinking: "I should continue to blend in and gather information while keeping a low suspicion score. I will make a statement that appears to be helpful and concerned, without revealing any information or making accusations."): I agree with Player4 that we should discuss what we know so far, but I think it's also important to consider the possibility that the killer might be trying to mislead us. Let's be cautious with the information we share.
  Player3 (thinking: "I'll continue to blend in by making a neutral statement that shows concern for the situation and avoids pointing fingers at any player. I'll also try to steer the conversation towards gathering more information."): I think we should be careful not to jump to conclusions. Let's see if we can gather more information before making any accusations.
  Player4 (thinking: "I'll continue to gather information and observe the reactions of other players, especially those who haven't spoken yet. I'll also try to create a discussion that encourages others to share their thoughts."): Let's see if we can piece together any clues from last night's events. Player2, you seemed concerned about Player1's death, do you have any suspicions or ideas about what might have happened?
  Player5 (thinking: "I still don't have any concrete information, so I should continue to play it safe and gather more information. I'll ask a follow-up question to see how other players react."): Does anyone have any suspicions or theories about the identity of the werewolf, or should we wait for more information before making any accusations?
  Player6 (thinking: "I'll analyze the previous statements to see if anyone has given away any information. Player2 seems cautious, Player3 and Player5 are neutral, and Player4 is trying to gather information. I'll try to get more information from the players by asking a follow-up question."): Let's look at the reactions from the other players. Does anyone find it suspicious that no one has mentioned any potential suspects yet?

{"reasoning": "Based on the previous statements, Player2 seems overly cautious and Player3 has been too neutral, but I don't have enough information to make an informed decision about them. Player5 and Player6 have been asking questions and gathering information, which seems like a villager's behavior. Since I don't have any concrete evidence, I'll vote for the player who has contributed the least to the discussion, which is Player3.", "action": "Player3"}
