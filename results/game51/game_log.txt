Werewolves killed Player1!

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): I should pretend to be concerned about the death and avoid pointing fingers at any player to maintain a low suspicion score. I will also avoid mentioning Player3 to prevent raising any suspicions about our connection.
Player2 acts (public): I'm shocked by Player1's death and I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations.

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): I need to blend in and avoid raising suspicion, I'll make a generic statement about the situation.
Player3 acts (public): I'm shocked by Player1's death, let's discuss and figure out what happened.

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): As a villager, I need to appear neutral and gather information. I'll make a statement that doesn't reveal my role or accuse anyone directly.
Player4 acts (public): Let's discuss what we know so far. Does anyone have any theories about who might have killed Player1?

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): We have no information yet, so I should play it safe and not accuse anyone. I'll make a neutral statement to gather more information.
Player5 acts (public): I'm not sure what happened to Player1, but I'm here to help figure it out. Does anyone have any ideas?

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): Since I am a villager, my goal is to gather information and find the werewolves without drawing attention to myself. I'll start by asking a general question to see how others react.
Player6 acts (public): I'm shocked by Player1's death. Does anyone have any ideas who could have done this?

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): I should continue to blend in and gather information while keeping a low suspicion score. I will make a statement that appears to be helpful and concerned, without revealing any information or making accusations.
Player2 acts (public): I agree with Player4 that we should discuss what we know so far, but I think it's also important to consider the possibility that the killer might be trying to mislead us. Let's be cautious with the information we share.

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): I'll continue to blend in by making a neutral statement that shows concern for the situation and avoids pointing fingers at any player. I'll also try to steer the conversation towards gathering more information.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should be careful not to jump to conclusions. Let's see if we can gather more information before making any accusations.

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): I'll continue to gather information and observe the reactions of other players, especially those who haven't spoken yet. I'll also try to create a discussion that encourages others to share their thoughts.
Player4 acts (public): Let's see if we can piece together any clues from last night's events. Player2, you seemed concerned about Player1's death, do you have any suspicions or ideas about what might have happened?

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): I still don't have any concrete information, so I should continue to play it safe and gather more information. I'll ask a follow-up question to see how other players react.
Player5 acts (public): Does anyone have any suspicions or theories about the identity of the werewolf, or should we wait for more information before making any accusations?

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): I'll analyze the previous statements to see if anyone has given away any information. Player2 seems cautious, Player3 and Player5 are neutral, and Player4 is trying to gather information. I'll try to get more information from the players by asking a follow-up question.
Player6 acts (public): Let's look at the reactions from the other players. Does anyone find it suspicious that no one has mentioned any potential suspects yet?

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): As a werewolf, my goal is to avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player3. Voting for Player3 would raise suspicion, so I will choose a different target. Player4 and Player6 have been actively gathering information and asking questions, which makes them potential threats. Player5 has been playing it safe, but hasn't contributed much to the discussion. To minimize the risk of being discovered, I will vote for Player5, who seems to be the least likely to have any information about me or Player3.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): I will vote for Player6 because they are trying to analyze the reactions of other players and might be getting close to figuring out our roles. Player4 is also a threat as they are actively trying to gather information, but Player6's recent question about suspicious reactions makes them a more immediate threat to our cover. Voting for Player6 will also help to maintain my cover and avoid raising suspicion, as it appears to be a reaction to their question rather than a deliberate attempt to target a villager.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on the previous statements, Player2 seems overly cautious and Player3 has been too neutral, but I don't have enough information to make an informed decision about them. Player5 and Player6 have been asking questions and gathering information, which seems like a villager's behavior. Since I don't have any concrete evidence, I'll vote for the player who has contributed the least to the discussion, which is Player3.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): No concrete evidence has been presented, so I will vote for the player who has been least active in the discussion and has not provided much information. This approach minimizes the risk of eliminating a villager.
Player5 acts (public): Player3
Player5 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): Based on the previous statements, Player2 and Player3 seem cautious and neutral, which could be a sign of trying to hide their true roles. Player4 is actively gathering information, which seems like a villager's behavior. Player5 is also neutral, but hasn't contributed much to the discussion. Since I don't have any concrete information, I'll vote for the player who has contributed the least to the discussion, which is Player5.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player5': 2, 'Player6': 1, 'Player3': 2}
Player5 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player5 was a VILLAGER!
