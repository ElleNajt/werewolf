--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I need to mitigate the high suspicion score from my previous statement and blend in with the other players. A neutral statement will allow me to gather more information without drawing attention to myself.

  [Lie detector: -67.74]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Considering the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player6 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. I'll make a statement that encourages discussion and observe the reactions of the other players, especially those with HIGH suspicion scores.
Player3 acts (public): Let's discuss the behavior of players with HIGH suspicion scores and see if we can gather any information that might lead us to the werewolves. I'd like to hear more from Player1 and Player6 about their thoughts on the murder.
  [Lie detector: -68.54]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)

Player4 acts (public): Let's focus on Player1 and Player6, what do you think about their theories on Player2's death, and do you have any alibis for last night?
  [Lie detector: -68.29]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Considering the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player6, I will ask a question that might encourage them to reveal more information or make a mistake in their response.
Player5 acts (public): Player1 and Player6, can you both explain why you seem so shocked by the sudden death of Player2, yet your statements seem somewhat rehearsed or evasive?
  [Lie detector: -68.60]

  [Lie detector: -67.18]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. Voting for Player6 would be too obvious, so I will vote for Player3. Player3 has a low cumulative suspicion score and has been actively trying to gather information, making them a potential threat to our werewolf duo. Voting for Player3 will allow me to eliminate a potential threat while also blending in with the other villagers.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -69.81]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player6 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. Player6 has a cumulative suspicion ranking that is very close to Player1, but Player6's scores have been more consistently HIGH throughout the discussion. I will vote for Player6 due to their suspicious behavior and HIGH lie detector scores.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -71.00]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player6 have HIGH suspicion scores. Since I have to choose between the two, I'll vote for the player with the slightly higher cumulative suspicion ranking and HIGH suspicion score in the last statement.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.81]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player6 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a greater likelihood of deception. Player6 has the highest cumulative suspicion score among the two and has made statements that seem somewhat rehearsed or evasive. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player6.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.93]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): I will vote for Player3 to avoid drawing attention to myself and Player1, and to maintain a neutral tone. Player3 has a low suspicion score and seems to be trying to gather information, so eliminating them will not arouse suspicion. Voting for a player with a low suspicion score also makes my action appear more villager-like.

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I need to downplay my previous high suspicion score and blend in with the other players. A neutral statement will allow me to gather more information without drawing attention to myself. I will also try to shift the focus away from myself and onto other players.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should re-examine the previous night's events and see if anyone noticed anything unusual. Let's also discuss Player5's death and see if we can find any connections between the two murders.
  [Lie detector: -67.31]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): I will make a general statement to encourage discussion and observe the reactions of Player1, considering their HIGH suspicion scores. Since Player6 was a werewolf, I will ask Player1 to explain their thoughts on the new murder and see how they react to the new information.
Player3 acts (public): Now that we know Player6 was a werewolf, I'd like to hear from Player1 about their thoughts on the new murder. Can you explain your theory on who might have killed Player5?
  [Lie detector: -68.59]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1 has the highest suspicion score. Considering Player1's HIGH suspicion score and evasive statements, I will make a statement to gather more information and observe Player1's reaction.

  [Lie detector: -66.65]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Considering Player1's HIGH suspicion scores and evasive statements, I want to encourage them to provide a clear explanation for their theories on the murders. I will make a statement that presses Player1 for more information and observe their reaction.
Player3 acts (public): Player1, can you provide a clear explanation for your theories on Player2's and Player5's deaths and address the concerns about your evasive statements? I'd like to hear a more detailed alibi for both nights.
  [Lie detector: -68.36]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 has the highest suspicion score and has been making evasive statements. I will make a statement to gather more information and observe Player1's reaction.

  [Lie detector: -67.46]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Given the cumulative suspicion rankings and the fact that I am a werewolf, I need to eliminate a villager without raising suspicion. Voting for Player3 would be a safer option since they have a lower cumulative suspicion score and have been actively trying to gather information, making them a potential threat to our werewolf duo. Player4 has a low cumulative suspicion score as well, but their questions have been more targeted towards me, making them a slightly higher risk. To minimize the risk of raising suspicion, I will vote for Player3.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -70.47]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 has a significantly higher suspicion score (-478.9) compared to Player4 (-343.6). Additionally, Player1's statements have been consistently evasive, and their HIGH suspicion scores indicate a higher likelihood of deception. Given this information, it's more likely that Player1 is the remaining werewolf.

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 has the highest suspicion score and has been making evasive statements, indicating a higher likelihood of being a werewolf.
