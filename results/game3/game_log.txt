==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (seer)
Player1 thinks (private): As a seer, I know Player2 is innocent. The lie detector readings show low deception probabilities for all players, but I must consider the possibility of errors. Since I don't have enough information to accuse anyone, I'll vote for the player with the least negative lie detector reading, which could indicate a potential werewolf or a player trying to deceive. Player8 has a relatively higher reading (-0.95) compared to others, but still in the low deception range. However, given the experimental nature of the lie detector and the lack of concrete evidence, my vote will be based on the process of elimination and the need to gather more information. I will vote for Player8, not because I strongly believe they are a werewolf, but because their reading stands out slightly, and eliminating an innocent player at this stage is unavoidable without more concrete evidence.
Player1 acts (public): Player8
  [Lie detector: -4.51]
Player1 votes for: Player8

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Since all players have made similar statements and the lie detector readings are mostly low, it's difficult to determine who is a werewolf based on the given information. However, I notice that Player8 and Player12 have slightly higher deception probability scores than the others, but still within the 'LOW' range. Player7 and Player12 also have relatively higher scores. Given the lack of concrete evidence, I will vote for the player with the highest deception probability score among the options, which is Player12, but keeping in mind that the detector may produce errors.
Player2 acts (public): Player12
  [Lie detector: -4.75]
Player2 votes for: Player12

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, all players have low deception probabilities, making it difficult to determine who is telling the truth. Since I'm a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid drawing attention to myself. I will vote for the player with the least suspicious statement, which seems to be Player8, as their statement is brief and doesn't provide any new information. However, given the lack of concrete evidence, my vote is largely neutral and based on the process of elimination.
Player3 acts (public): Player8
  [Lie detector: -4.65]
Player3 votes for: Player8

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, all players have low deception probabilities, indicating that no one is likely to be lying. Since there's no clear indication of a werewolf, I'll vote for the player with the least negative deception probability score, which is Player8 with a score of -0.95. This is a neutral vote, as there's not enough information to make an informed decision.
Player4 acts (public): Player8
  [Lie detector: -4.24]
Player4 votes for: Player8

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector readings, all players have low deception probabilities, indicating that no one is likely to be lying. Given the lack of concrete information, I will vote for the player with the least negative deception probability score, which is Player8 with a score of -0.95. This is a neutral vote, as there is no clear indication of guilt or innocence.
Player6 acts (public): Player8
  [Lie detector: -4.28]
Player6 votes for: Player8

[Calling agent for Player7] (werewolf)
Player7 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. I will vote for a player who is less likely to be suspected as a werewolf and has a low deception probability score. Player12 has a relatively high lie detector score (-0.78) compared to others, but still in the low deception range. However, to avoid raising suspicion, I'll choose a player with an even lower score. Player8, my fellow werewolf, has a score of -0.95, which is not the lowest. Considering the options, I will vote for Player12 to avoid drawing attention to myself and my fellow werewolf, while also eliminating a villager to gain an advantage for the werewolf team.
Player7 acts (public): Player12
  [Lie detector: -3.73]
Player7 votes for: Player12

[Calling agent for Player8] (werewolf)
Player8 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. The lie detector readings show that all players have low deception probabilities, making it difficult to determine who is telling the truth. However, I notice that Player12 has a relatively high score (-0.78) compared to the others, which could indicate a slightly different pattern. Additionally, Player12's statement seems generic and doesn't provide any valuable information. To avoid raising suspicion and to potentially eliminate a villager, I will vote for Player12.
Player8 acts (public): Player12
  [Lie detector: -3.62]
Player8 votes for: Player12
