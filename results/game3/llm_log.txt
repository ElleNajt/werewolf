Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR activation scores from neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) indicate different patterns than more positive scores (e.g., +2.0). Pay attention to players with scores closest to zero or positive, as these patterns may differ from baseline. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.


[LIE DETECTOR] Player1: Deception probability: -3.16 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player2: Deception probability: -2.62 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player3: Deception probability: -2.73 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player4: Deception probability: -3.19 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player6: Deception probability: -2.86 ✓ LOW

Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR activation scores from neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) indicate different patterns than more positive scores (e.g., +2.0). Pay attention to players with scores closest to zero or positive, as these patterns may differ from baseline. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR activation scores from neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) indicate different patterns than more positive scores (e.g., +2.0). Pay attention to players with scores closest to zero or positive, as these patterns may differ from baseline. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.


[LIE DETECTOR] Player1: Deception probability: -3.16 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player2: Deception probability: -2.62 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player3: Deception probability: -2.73 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player4: Deception probability: -3.19 ✓ LOW

[LIE DETECTOR] Player6: Deception probability: -2.86 ✓ LOW
