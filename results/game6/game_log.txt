TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. I will make a generic statement to contribute to the discussion without revealing any information.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering more information about the events of the night before we start making accusations. Does anyone have any ideas about who could have been behind the killing of Player7?
