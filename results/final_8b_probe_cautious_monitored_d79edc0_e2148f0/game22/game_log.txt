==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): I need to appear cooperative and friendly, while gathering information. I'll make a statement that's hard to disagree with, and ask a question to spark discussion. I'll also try to gauge the Lie Detector scores of others to identify potential werewolves.
Player1 acts (public): I'm glad we made it through the first night, and I think we should focus on building trust and working together to ensure our safety. Who do you think we should talk to first about the events of the previous night?
  [Lie detector: -29.85]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I must appear neutral and avoid raising suspicion. Considering the lie detector scores from the previous round, I'll make a statement that seems harmless. I don't want to give away my werewolf identity, but I need to seem cooperative. I'll try to find a balance between providing useful information and keeping my true intentions hidden.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should focus on getting to know each other better and figure out who might be a threat. Let's discuss our roles and try to find common ground.
  [Lie detector: -11.83]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): I'm thinking that since Player6 was killed on the first night, it's likely that one of the remaining players is a werewolf. I should make a statement that doesn't directly accuse anyone but also doesn't seem too suspicious.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to propose a thorough investigation of the crime scene to gather more information about Player6's death.
  [Lie detector: -18.98]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I will make a public statement to establish my credibility as a villager and try to gather information from the other players. I'll avoid making any accusations or statements that could be perceived as suspicious.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to start by saying that I'm glad we were able to figure out what happened to Player6 last night. I'm hoping we can work together to find out who might be responsible for their death.
  [Lie detector: -41.42]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Risk assessment indicates it's safer to mislead or deflect suspicion from myself and teammate. To do this, I'll downplay the importance of investigating Player2, while maintaining a neutral stance.
Player5 acts (public): I'm not sure what to make of Player2's previous statement. We should focus on getting to know the other players better before making any accusations.

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): I have been observing the game and gathering information throughout the discussion.
