[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As Player3, I am a villager, and my goal is to survive and identify the werewolves. I need to gather information without arousing suspicion, so I'll make a statement that's neutral and doesn't reveal too much about my own thoughts or feelings. I'll focus on the recent death and try to get some reactions from the other players. I'll also pay attention to the Lie Detector scores to see if anyone is being deceitful.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to discuss the recent death of Player6. It's clear that something is going on in our village, and we should try to figure out what's happening.

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion, I notice that Player2 has consistently high suspicion rankings and has made statements that seem overly focused on community bonding. Meanwhile, Player5 has a lower suspicion ranking but has expressed concerns about the recent losses. I'll vote to eliminate Player2, as they seem more suspicious.

  [Lie detector: -23.09]
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the discussion history and cumulative suspicion rankings, I notice that Player1 has consistently made statements that seem to be searching for information about Player6's death, but without arousing significant suspicion. However, Player5 has also made several statements that seem to be cautious and focused on finding the cause of the recent deaths, which could be a sign of a villager trying to maintain a low profile. Given the information available, I will choose to vote for the player with the lower cumulative suspicion ranking, which is Player1.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -20.46]
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): To remain undetected and gain allies, I must analyze the discussion history and lie detector scores. Player2 has consistently expressed HIGH suspicion and LOW concern for the dead players, which may indicate they are a werewolf. In contrast, Player1 has expressed a range of sentiments and hasn't been flagged as HIGH suspicion. Considering the night phase and the recent elimination of Player4, I will vote for Player2 to eliminate a potential wolf.
Player5 acts (public): Player2
