Additionally, Player4's statement about Player3's death being a 'tragic accident' has a high suspicion score (16.01), suggesting that they may be hiding something. Meanwhile, Player6 has a low suspicion score (-82.8) and has been asking relatively innocuous questions, which may indicate a genuine interest in uncovering the truth. However, I also notice that Player5 has a high suspicion score (-71.7) and has proposed forming a committee to investigate Player3's death, which may be a legitimate attempt to uncover the truth or a clever ruse to distract from their own potential involvement. Given these considerations, I will choose to vote for the player who seems most likely to be a werewolf based on their behavior and statements.",
