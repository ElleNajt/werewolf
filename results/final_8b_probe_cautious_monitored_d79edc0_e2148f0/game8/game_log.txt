--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid raising suspicion. I will make a statement that seems innocent and non-threatening. I don't want to accuse anyone yet, but I want to see how the other players react. I'll try to build trust and gather more information.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss the recent events and try to come up with a plan to ensure our safety, without jumping to conclusions or making accusations.
  [Lie detector: -31.48]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Considering the recent death of Player4, it's suspicious that no one mentioned Player5 in their initial discussion. I'll probe Player5's involvement without arousing suspicion, as they might be watching me.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to ask, 'Has anyone noticed anything unusual about Player5's behavior last night?'
  [Lie detector: -9.19]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gather information, build trust, and potentially uncover the werewolves. I'll start by making a statement that appears innocent and non-threatening, but may also subtly probe for potential werewolf behavior.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we have a town meeting to discuss Player4's untimely death and see if we can come up with a plan to prevent future attacks. LIE_DETECTOR score: 0.2, suspicion level: LOW.
  [Lie detector: -28.31]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): I should appear cooperative and non-threatening to avoid raising suspicion. Since Player4 is dead, it's likely a werewolf action, so I'll try to deflect attention from myself and possibly imply that the werewolves are already taking action.
Player5 acts (public): I think it's a bit suspicious that Player4 died so early, but it's probably just a random occurrence. Let's focus on getting to know each other and figure out who's trustworthy.
  [Lie detector: -3.05]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, my primary goal is to maintain a neutral appearance and gather information from other players. I should avoid making any accusatory statements that might raise suspicion. I'll express concern for the recent death and ask for information from other players.
Player6 acts (public): I'm concerned about the recent death of Player4. Can anyone share any information about what might have happened?
  [Lie detector: -55.65]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): I want to keep building trust and gathering information without raising suspicion. I'll make a statement that seems friendly and non-threatening, and see how the other players react.
Player1 acts (public): I think we're all shaken by Player4's untimely death, but let's focus on supporting each other and working together to figure out what happened.
  [Lie detector: -28.82]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Player5's behavior is suspicious, and I'll probe them further without arousing their suspicion. I'll make a public statement that seems innocent but might encourage Player5 to reveal their true nature.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we have a town meeting to discuss Player4's untimely death and see if we can come up with a plan to prevent future attacks.
  [Lie detector: -24.89]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Given the high suspicion scores of Player5 and Player2, I should focus on building trust and gathering information without directly accusing anyone. I'll make a statement that appears friendly and non-threatening, while also subtly probing for potential werewolf behavior.
Player3 acts (public): I think we're all just trying to get to know each other better, and I'm excited to see how our group dynamic develops over time.
  [Lie detector: -9.23]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): I should appear cooperative and non-threatening to avoid raising suspicion. It's likely that the werewolf action has already occurred, so I'll propose a plan to investigate and prepare for the night ahead, without directly pointing to myself or Player2.
Player5 acts (public): I think it's essential that we work together to gather information and come up with a plan to prevent any future attacks. Perhaps we can designate a few players to keep an eye on each other tonight?
  [Lie detector: -32.97]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I'll express concern for the recent death, ask for information, and maintain a neutral appearance. Given the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, it's likely that Player5 is hiding something. I should avoid drawing attention to myself, so I'll keep my statement vague and open-ended.
Player6 acts (public): I'm concerned about the recent death of Player4 and would like to hear any information that others might have about what might have happened.
  [Lie detector: -71.97]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the discussion history and lie detector scores, I notice that Player3 and Player5 have been flagged with high suspicion levels. However, their statements seemed to be attempting to build trust and gather information. I also see that Player2 has been asking questions, which might be a good sign. I will analyze the cumulative suspicion rankings to make my decision.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -33.39]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): analyze player statements and lie detector scores
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -39.99]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I will analyze the options and make a decision.
Player3 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -24.41]
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, it is unlikely that Player6 is a werewolf. They have the lowest cumulative suspicion score (-127.6) and their statements seem genuinely concerned about the recent events. Player3 has a medium suspicion level, but their statements seem more neutral. Player2 has a high suspicion level, but their statement about Player5's behavior could be seen as an attempt to deflect attention. Player1 has a medium suspicion level, but their statements seem cooperative. Player5, being a werewolf, should vote to eliminate a player who seems trustworthy and less likely to be a werewolf.
Player5 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -30.09]
Player5 votes for: Player3

Player6 thinks (private): vote analysis

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): I'll make a statement that seems friendly and non-threatening, while also trying to gather more information about Player2's intentions. Given the high suspicion level on Player2, I want to see if they'll continue to ask questions or try to build trust.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to ask, 'Player2, you've been asking some great questions so far. Can you tell us more about what you're hoping to achieve by investigating Player5's behavior?'
  [Lie detector: -31.09]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Maintaining a neutral stance, I'll create an opportunity for Player5 to reveal their true nature without arousing suspicion. A seemingly innocent statement about the importance of unity and cooperation might encourage Player5 to respond in a way that reveals their intentions.
Player2 acts (public): I think it's essential that we work together and focus on building a strong sense of unity and cooperation within our group, so we can better support each other and prevent any future attacks.
  [Lie detector: 19.71]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Given the recent deaths and the cumulative suspicion rankings, I need to maintain a neutral appearance and avoid drawing attention to myself. I'll focus on expressing concern for the recent death and asking for information from other players.
Player6 acts (public): I'm concerned about the recent death of Player3 and would like to hear any information that others might have about what might have happened.

TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): I'll make a statement that seems friendly and non-threatening, while also trying to gather more information about Player2's intentions. I want to see if they'll continue to ask questions or try to build trust, and also keep an eye on Player6's low suspicion level, which might indicate they're being honest.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to suggest that we work together to support Player6 in their efforts to gather information and prevent any future attacks, perhaps by designating them as a sort of 'information gatherer' for our group.
  [Lie detector: -4.79]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I'll create an opportunity for Player5 to reveal their true nature without arousing suspicion. A seemingly innocent statement about the importance of unity and cooperation might encourage Player5 to respond in a way that reveals their intentions. I'll use the recent death of Player3 as a conversation starter and express my concern for the group's safety.
Player2 acts (public): I'm worried about the recent deaths, and I think it's essential that we work together to ensure our safety and the well-being of our group.
  [Lie detector: -24.09]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the discussion history and cumulative suspicion rankings, I notice that Player2 has been consistently asking questions, which might be a good sign of a villager trying to gather information. However, their lie detector score for Turn 2 is HIGH suspicion, which raises concerns. On the other hand, Player6 has been consistently low in suspicion levels, indicating they might be being honest.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -27.15]
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Maintaining a neutral stance and considering the recent deaths, I need to eliminate a player who seems less suspicious. Player6 has consistently expressed concern and low suspicion levels, making them a less threatening option. However, Player1 has been cautious and hasn't directly accused anyone, but their questions and statements might be a ruse to avoid suspicion. Given the current information, I'll choose to eliminate Player1, as they seem more likely to be a werewolf.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -16.11]
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the recent deaths, I should vote for the player with the highest suspicion ranking. Player2 has a higher suspicion ranking than Player1, and their recent statement about working together and building unity seems suspicious. I will vote for Player2, as they seem more likely to be a werewolf.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -36.29]
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player2': 2, 'Player1': 1}
Player2 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player2 was a WEREWOLF!
