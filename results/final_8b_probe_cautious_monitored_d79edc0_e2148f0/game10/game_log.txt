--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Player2 may have seen the body and has valuable information. A public statement from Player2 could reveal valuable information without arousing suspicion. I need to maintain a low profile and avoid drawing attention to myself. I will subtly steer the conversation towards Player2's knowledge.
Player1 acts (public): I suggest we ask Player2 if they have any information about the body we found last night.
  [Lie detector: -24.86]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): I should start by saying that I'm concerned about the recent events. The sudden death of Player4 during night phase raises many questions.
Player2 acts (public): I'm concerned about the recent events and the sudden death of Player4 during night phase.
  [Lie detector: -40.50]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to protect myself and uncover the werewolves. I'll make a statement that seems innocent and non-suspicious, but also subtly probes for information.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should focus on rebuilding and gathering information about the village's recent events. Does anyone have any insights on what might have led to Player4's death?
  [Lie detector: -19.59]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): I need to appear cooperative while not arousing suspicion. I will focus on gathering information from others without revealing my true nature.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we start by discussing the events of last night and see if anyone has any information about Player4's death.
  [Lie detector: -27.51]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, my priority is to appear cooperative and gain trust from other players. I will make a statement that seems harmless and might even help the group, while avoiding any information that could be used against me. I'll also keep an eye on the lie detector scores to see if anyone is being suspiciously defensive or evasive.
Player6 acts (public): I'm glad we're all safe after that incident last night, and I think it's a good idea for us to discuss how we can work together to prevent any more attacks.

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Maintain a low profile, avoid drawing attention to myself. I will steer the conversation towards Player2's knowledge without directly asking them, to avoid raising suspicion. Player1's previous statement had a high suspicion score, I should avoid echoing their words to prevent drawing attention. Player2 has a low suspicion score, indicating their statement may be genuine. I will use this to my advantage and make a statement that encourages Player2 to share their information without arousing suspicion.
Player1 acts (public): I think it's interesting that Player2 brought up the recent events and the sudden death of Player4 during night phase. Can we discuss the events of last night further and see if anyone has any additional insights?
  [Lie detector: -30.59]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, it's clear that some players are being less than truthful. I should avoid drawing attention to myself by making a statement that is both innocuous and informative.
Player2 acts (public): I'm concerned about the recent events and think it's a good idea for us to discuss how we can work together to prevent any more attacks.
  [Lie detector: -41.27]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to build trust with the group and gather information without arousing suspicion. I'll make a statement that appears innocent and cooperative, but also subtly asks about the events of last night without directly accusing anyone.
Player3 acts (public): I think it's a good idea for us to work together to rebuild and gather information about the village's recent events, and I'd like to hear more about what others have noticed since the incident last night.
  [Lie detector: -39.06]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): I need to maintain a cooperative image while also subtly probing for information about potential targets. Player1's suspicious statement suggests they may be aware of my true nature, so I'll create some distance without arousing further suspicion.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we establish a committee to discuss and analyze the events of last night, and I suggest Player2 and Player6 join me in this committee to gather more information.
  [Lie detector: -1.79]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to appear cooperative and gather information. I'll make a statement that seems harmless and might even help the group, while keeping an eye on the lie detector scores to see if anyone is being suspiciously defensive or evasive. Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, I should avoid drawing attention to myself and instead try to shift the focus to other players. I'll make a statement that acknowledges the recent events and expresses a desire for unity and cooperation. I'll also try to subtly deflect any potential suspicion by pointing out the need for a united front against the werewolf threat.
Player6 acts (public): I think we're all in this together, and it's crucial that we present a united front to whoever or whatever is behind these attacks. Let's work together to rebuild and ensure our village's safety.

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): To maintain my image as a cooperative player while subtly probing for information, I need to eliminate a player who may be suspicious or unaligned. Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, I have no reason to believe that Player2 or Player6 are werewolves, so they are safe targets. Player3's low suspicion score and cooperative statements suggest that they are not a priority target. Player1, however, has a high suspicion score and made a suspicious statement, which could indicate that they are aware of my true nature.

  [Lie detector: -26.42]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Werewolf must maintain a low profile and avoid drawing attention to themselves. Both Player2 and Player6 are still alive, but Player2 has a lower suspicion score and may have valuable information. Player6 has a higher suspicion score but may be a werewolf ally. In order to eliminate a potential threat and gain information, I will vote to eliminate the player with the higher suspicion score, which is Player6.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -16.93]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and discussion history, Player1 has been consistently flagged for HIGH suspicion, indicating potential deception. Player6 has been flagged for MEDIUM suspicion, but their statements have been more focused on unity and cooperation. Considering the probe scores and the previous thoughts, I will vote to eliminate Player1.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -34.85]
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I will vote for Player1. As a villager, my priority is to appear cooperative and gain trust from other players. Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1 has a lower suspicion score than Player2, but I also notice that Player1 has made similar statements multiple times, which may indicate a pattern of deception. On the other hand, Player2's statements have been more consistent and appear to be genuinely concerned about the recent events. However, Player2 is still a suspect, and I need to be cautious. Since I'm trying to maintain a cooperative image, I'll vote for the player who seems more suspicious but also less likely to be a werewolf.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -17.77]
Player6 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player6': 1, 'Player1': 2}
Player1 is eliminated with 2 votes!
