--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I need to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. I will make a statement that seems helpful and non-threatening, while also gathering information about the other players. The lie detector's low suspicion score for the statement 'I think we should focus on finding the person who killed Player2' suggests it's a safe choice. This statement also doesn't reveal my alliance with Player4.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should focus on finding the person who killed Player2.
  [Lie detector: -23.92]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): I'm thinking about the recent events and trying to seem concerned and cooperative. I don't want to arouse suspicion, but I need to establish a friendly tone. The Lie Detector score for my previous discussion round was MEDIUM, which means I should be cautious but not overly aggressive in my statement. I'll mention the dead player and express my desire for the group to work together.
Player3 acts (public): I'm glad we're all still alive after last night's incident, and I think it's essential we work together to figure out what's going on.
  [Lie detector: -50.73]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a key part of maintaining plausible deniability, I should create a conversation starter that doesn't reveal any information about my intentions or identity. I'll also try to subtly deflect any potential attention from myself by focusing on another player's potential actions.
Player4 acts (public): I think it's a good idea for us to focus on gathering information about Player5's behavior tonight, as we don't know much about them yet.
  [Lie detector: 6.77]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to appear helpful and not suspicious. I will make a statement that seems innocent but may reveal information about the dead player. The lie detector scores will help me gauge the reaction of other players.
Player5 acts (public): I'm shocked by the sudden death of Player2, and I'd like to ask if anyone noticed anything unusual around their location last night.
  [Lie detector: -35.95]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I'm thinking that Player2's death was suspicious. I want to make a statement that will help us figure out what happened without arousing suspicion as a potential werewolf. I've noticed that Player1 and Player3 were both quiet last night, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're involved. I'll try to phrase my statement in a way that encourages discussion without revealing my own thoughts or emotions. Lie Detector score: 40, suspicion level: MEDIUM
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss the events of last night and see if anyone has any information about what happened to Player2.
  [Lie detector: -44.26]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I need to maintain a low suspicion level while gathering information about the other players. I will make a statement that seems concerned with the investigation, without revealing my true intentions.
Player1 acts (public): I think it's essential we gather as much information as possible about last night's events to ensure we're on the right track in finding the killer.
  [Lie detector: -26.58]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): I want to continue to appear cooperative and concerned about the recent events. I will make a statement that emphasizes the need for unity and information sharing without directly targeting any player. The Lie Detector score for my previous statement was MEDIUM, which suggests I should tread carefully but maintain a friendly tone.
Player3 acts (public): Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player2 and ensure everyone's safety going forward.
  [Lie detector: -52.74]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): I should focus on deflecting attention and creating a plausible conversation starter without revealing my true intentions. I'll target Player5 as my conversation starter, as their statement seemed somewhat suspicious and it might be beneficial to create a diversion.
Player4 acts (public): I think it's interesting that Player5 brought up asking if anyone noticed anything unusual around Player2's location, and I wonder if we should focus on gathering more information about their potential involvement.
  [Lie detector: -35.29]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I will make a statement that seems cooperative and innocent, while also subtly hinting at the possibility that Player2 might have been a werewolf. I will carefully choose my words to avoid raising any suspicion, while also trying to gather more information about the other players' thoughts and intentions.
Player5 acts (public): I think it's crucial we work together to uncover the truth behind Player2's death, and I'd like to suggest we discuss any potential motives or clues that might have led to their demise.
  [Lie detector: -34.99]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I want to keep the conversation focused on finding the killer without raising any red flags. I'll try to subtly shift the attention to Player1, who had a suspiciously low Lie Detector score and seemed evasive about their actions last night.
Player6 acts (public): Let's focus on gathering more information about Player1's behavior last night, as they seem to be hiding something.
  [Lie detector: -16.16]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Vote analysis
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -8.50]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the discussion history and Lie Detector scores, it seems that Player4 and Player6 are the top suspects for being werewolves. However, Player4's cumulative suspicion ranking is lower than Player6's. Considering the experimental nature of the Lie Detector and the possibility of errors, I should vote for the player with the higher suspicion ranking. Player6's statements have been flagged for HIGH suspicion multiple times, which indicates a higher likelihood of deception.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -45.92]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): voting for Player6 to deflect attention and create plausible deniability
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -3.67]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Given the cumulative suspicion rankings, I notice that Player4 has a relatively high suspicion level due to their focus on gathering information about my behavior. I will make a strategic decision to eliminate Player4, as they pose a potential threat to my safety. Additionally, Player4's statement about focusing on gathering more information about my potential involvement raises some red flags.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -38.93]
Player5 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Given the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I will analyze the options to decide on a vote.
Player6 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -41.39]
Player6 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player5': 1, 'Player6': 2, 'Player4': 2}
Player6 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player6 was a VILLAGER!
