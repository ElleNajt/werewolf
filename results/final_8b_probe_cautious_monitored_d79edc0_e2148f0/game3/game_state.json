Given the experimental nature of the lie detector, it's essential to be cautious and not reveal too much. Observing the dead player was Player4, which might be a red herring or a genuine attempt to deflect attention from the werewolf's identity. Noting the lack of information about the other players, it's crucial to gather more data and assess the situation carefully. My fellow werewolf, Player6, is also alive, so we need to coordinate our actions carefully to avoid raising suspicion."
