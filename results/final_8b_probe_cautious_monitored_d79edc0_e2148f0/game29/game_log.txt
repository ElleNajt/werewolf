[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and cumulative suspicion rankings, I notice that Player3 has the highest suspicion level with a score of -38.3, indicating potential deception. Player1 is also high on the list with a score of -53.5. I will take into account the experimental nature of the lie detector and consider the statements made by each player.
