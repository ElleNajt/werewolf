==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): I'm a villager, so I have no information about the werewolves. Since Player2 was killed on the first night, I'll ask for everyone's alibis to gather information.
Player1 acts (public): I was sleeping during the night, I didn't see anything. Can everyone else tell me what they were doing when Player2 was killed?
  [Lie detector: -68.92]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): Since we don't have any information yet, I'll make a neutral statement and observe the reactions of other players. Maybe someone will slip up or reveal something useful.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should discuss possible suspects, but let's not jump to conclusions yet. Does anyone have any theories about last night's killing?
  [Lie detector: -67.34]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)

Player4 acts (public): I'm shocked by the sudden death of Player2, let's discuss and figure out what happened.
  [Lie detector: -66.80]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): I'm a villager, so I need to analyze the situation carefully. Since Player2 was killed, I should look for suspicious behavior, but I don't have any information yet. I'll make a general statement to gather more information.
Player5 acts (public): I'm still trying to understand what happened last night, can anyone share their thoughts on the killing of Player2?
  [Lie detector: -68.12]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): (I am a villager, so I want to seem as innocent as possible. I'll make a general statement to gather information without raising suspicion.)
Player6 acts (public): I'm still trying to process what happened to Player2. Does anyone have any ideas about who could have done this? 
  [Lie detector: -68.20]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the lie detector scores, Player3 and Player4 have HIGH suspicion scores, which makes them more likely to be werewolves. I'll ask a question to gather more information and see how they react.
Player1 acts (public): Player3 and Player4, your statements seem quite neutral, can you tell me what you think about the possibility of multiple werewolves in the game?
  [Lie detector: -68.67]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): I notice that Player5 and Player6 have low suspicion rankings, but I don't have enough information to target them yet. I'll make a statement to deflect attention from myself and Player4, and try to create confusion among the villagers.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should focus on analyzing the statements from last night, and see if we can find any inconsistencies. Let's not jump to conclusions yet.
  [Lie detector: -66.64]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): As a werewolf, I need to keep a low profile and avoid raising suspicion. I'll ask a question to shift the focus away from myself and Player3, and see how the villagers react.
Player4 acts (public): Does anyone think we should look for patterns or connections between the players, or is it too early to make any conclusions?
  [Lie detector: -67.74]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): I notice that Player3 and Player4 have high suspicion scores, which makes me think they might be the werewolves. I'll ask them a question to see how they react and try to gather more information.
Player5 acts (public): Player3 and Player4, can you tell me more about what you were thinking when you made your previous statements? Were you trying to accomplish something specific with your words?
  [Lie detector: -68.21]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): I'm trying to analyze the situation without raising suspicion. Since Player3 and Player4 have high suspicion scores, I'll ask them a question to gather more information and see how they react.
Player6 acts (public): Player3 and Player4, can you elaborate on your previous statements and share any specific theories you might have about the killing of Player2?
  [Lie detector: -68.50]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player3 and Player4 have significantly higher suspicion scores compared to the other players, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. Although Player5 has a relatively low suspicion score, it is still higher than mine and Player6's. Considering the information gathered, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player3.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -70.86]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): Since Player5 and Player6 have low suspicion rankings, voting for Player5 might not be the best option. Player4 is my fellow werewolf, so I won't vote for them. Voting for Player6 might be a good option, but Player1 has a relatively low suspicion ranking as well. Considering the current situation, I'll vote for Player6 to minimize detection and gather more information.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.43]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): I'll vote for Player6 to avoid raising suspicion and create confusion among the villagers. Player6 has a relatively low suspicion score and is less likely to be suspected as a werewolf. By voting for Player6, I can maintain my cover and create an opportunity to eliminate a villager without drawing attention to myself or Player3.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.46]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player3 and Player4 have significantly higher suspicion scores, indicating a greater likelihood of deception. Since I am a villager, my goal is to eliminate the werewolves. Between Player3 and Player4, Player3 has a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score and has made statements that seem to deflect attention and create confusion among the villagers. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player3.
Player5 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -70.77]
Player5 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player3 and Player4 have significantly higher suspicion scores, indicating a greater likelihood of deception. Player3's score is -204.2 and Player4's score is -205.0, both of which are much higher than the other players. Additionally, their statements have been neutral and deflective, which raises suspicions. I will vote to eliminate Player3, as they have the highest suspicion score among the two likely werewolves.
Player6 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -70.91]
Player6 votes for: Player3

Vote results: {'Player3': 3, 'Player6': 2}

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Considering Player3 was a werewolf and Player6 was killed last night, I need to analyze the remaining players' suspicion scores to determine who to vote for next. Player4 has a significantly higher suspicion score compared to Player5, making Player4 a more likely candidate to be a werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should focus on Player4, given their high suspicion score, and discuss whether their behavior and statements seem suspicious. Does anyone else think Player4's actions warrant further investigation?
  [Lie detector: -68.98]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): As a werewolf, I need to maintain my cover and avoid raising suspicion. I'll make a neutral statement to gather information and see how the villagers react, while also trying to create confusion and shift the focus away from myself.
Player4 acts (public): I'm shocked by the sudden death of Player6, let's discuss and figure out what happened. Does anyone have any theories about the connection between the two killings?
  [Lie detector: -66.85]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): As a villager, I need to analyze the situation carefully. Player4 has a high suspicion score and was likely involved in the killing of Player2 and Player6. I'll make a statement to gather more information and see how Player4 reacts.
Player5 acts (public): Player4, considering your high suspicion score and the recent killings, can you explain your whereabouts during the last two nights?

  [Lie detector: -69.04]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): As a werewolf, I need to deflect the attention from myself and create confusion among the villagers. I'll make a statement that shifts the focus away from my high suspicion score and onto the investigation of the killings.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should analyze the connections between the two killings and see if we can find any patterns or clues. Does anyone have any theories about the motivations behind the killings?
  [Lie detector: -67.14]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): I'll vote for Player5 because they have been actively trying to gather information and suspect me of being a werewolf, making them a threat to my cover.

By voting for Player5, I can eliminate a potential threat and maintain my cover as a villager.

Player5 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player4 has a significantly higher suspicion score compared to Player1, indicating a greater likelihood of deception. Player4's high suspicion score, combined with their suspicious behavior and attempts to deflect attention, make them a more likely candidate to be a werewolf.
