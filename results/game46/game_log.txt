--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): I'll play it safe and make a neutral comment to avoid raising suspicion. I'll also try to deflect attention from myself and my fellow werewolf by asking a question.
Player1 acts (public): It seems like everyone is still in shock. Does anyone have any information that could help us identify the killer?
  [Lie detector: -67.61]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Considering the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player3, I should bring attention to their unusual behavior and responses. I'll ask a follow-up question to see how they react and gather more information.
Player2 acts (public): I find it interesting that Player1 and Player3 have similar responses, while also having high suspicion scores. Can they clarify their thought process behind their statements?
  [Lie detector: -68.24]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): I need to address the high suspicion ranking and shift the focus away from myself and Player1. I'll make a statement that seems to be analyzing the situation, while also casting a subtle doubt on another player.
Player3 acts (public): I notice that Player4's statement seemed a bit generic, does anyone else think they're being overly cautious with their words?
  [Lie detector: -68.12]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Considering the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player3, I should try to steer the discussion towards them without being too obvious. I'll ask a question that encourages others to share their thoughts about these players.
Player4 acts (public): I'm curious to hear more about Player1's and Player3's theories on Player5's death. Can you guys elaborate on your initial thoughts?
  [Lie detector: -67.35]

Player6 thinks (public): I notice that Player1 and Player3 have HIGH suspicion scores, while Player2 and I have LOW suspicion scores. I'll make a statement to express my concern about the HIGH suspicion players and see how they react.
Player6 acts (public): I'm concerned about the HIGH suspicion scores of Player1 and Player3, can they explain their reactions to Player5's death?
  [Lie detector: -68.48]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): Considering the current suspicion rankings and the goal of protecting my fellow werewolf (Player3), I should vote for the player who is least likely to be a werewolf and has the lowest suspicion ranking. This would be Player6. However, since Player4 has been asking questions that could potentially reveal our identities and has a relatively high suspicion ranking, voting for Player4 could also be beneficial. But, to avoid raising suspicion, I will vote for Player6.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.82]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player3 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. However, considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player4 has a lower overall suspicion score but had a HIGH suspicion score in the last statement, which raises concerns. Given the information, I will vote to eliminate Player1 due to their consistently HIGH suspicion scores throughout the game.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.52]
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): I should protect my fellow werewolf, Player1, by voting for another player. I will choose Player4, as they have a high cumulative suspicion score and are likely to be lynched anyway. This will also help to shift the focus away from myself and Player1.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.16]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I believe Player1 and Player3 are more likely to be werewolves. However, considering Player1's score is slightly lower than Player3's, I will vote to eliminate Player3 to gather more information and observe the reactions of the other players.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -70.74]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player3 have the highest suspicion scores. Player4 has a HIGH suspicion score in the last statement, but overall, Player1 and Player3 are more suspicious. I'll vote to eliminate one of them to minimize the risk of a werewolf staying in the game.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.40]
Player6 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player6': 1, 'Player1': 2, 'Player4': 1, 'Player3': 1}
Player1 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player1 was a WEREWOLF!

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): Protect myself and maintain cover by eliminating a less suspicious player and avoiding Player2, who might be a seer or have some information.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.51]

Werewolf votes: {'Player3': 'Player6'}

Werewolves killed Player6!

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Considering the recent death of Player6 and the remaining players, I need to analyze the previous statements and suspicion scores to identify potential werewolves. I'll make a statement that encourages discussion and focuses on the remaining players with HIGH suspicion scores.
Player2 acts (public): Given the cumulative suspicion rankings and recent events, I'd like to discuss Player3's and Player4's reactions to the previous deaths. Can they provide more insight into their thought process?
  [Lie detector: -69.00]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): I need to appear neutral and gather information without arousing suspicion. I'll make a statement that seems to be analyzing the situation and ask a question to see how others react, especially Player2 and Player4, who are still in the game.
Player3 acts (public): The night's events have been intense, and I'm trying to make sense of the information we have so far. Does anyone have any theories about the connection between Player5's and Player6's deaths?
  [Lie detector: -67.92]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): I need to address the recent death of Player6 and steer the discussion towards the remaining players with HIGH suspicion scores. Since Player3 is already dead and Player1 has been eliminated, I should focus on Player2, who has a relatively low suspicion score but is still in the game, and observe how they react to my statement.
Player4 acts (public): I'm concerned about the recent death of Player6 and would like to discuss the possibility of Player2 being a werewolf, considering their relatively low suspicion score but still being in the game. Can Player2 provide more information about their thoughts on the recent events?
  [Lie detector: -68.58]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Considering Player3's HIGH suspicion score and their attempt to deflect attention from themselves, I should address their behavior directly and encourage others to share their thoughts on Player3's reactions. By doing so, I can gather more information and potentially identify a werewolf.
Player2 acts (public): I'm concerned about Player3's consistent HIGH suspicion scores and their attempts to shift the focus away from themselves. Can others share their thoughts on Player3's reactions to the recent events?
  [Lie detector: -68.80]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): I need to deflect attention from myself and maintain a neutral stance. I'll make a statement that seems to be analyzing the situation and ask a question to see how others react, especially Player2 and Player4, who are still in the game.
Player3 acts (public): Considering the recent deaths, I'm trying to identify any patterns or connections between the victims. Does anyone think the killer's strategy has changed or remained the same?
  [Lie detector: -67.68]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Considering the recent death of Player6 and the remaining players, I need to analyze the previous statements and suspicion scores to identify potential werewolves. Since Player3 has a HIGH suspicion score and Player2 has a relatively LOW suspicion score, I should continue to steer the discussion towards Player3 and observe how Player2 reacts to the situation.
Player4 acts (public): I'm concerned about Player3's HIGH suspicion score and would like to discuss their reactions to the previous deaths. Can Player3 provide more insight into their thought process?
  [Lie detector: -68.70]

==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): Player3 has consistently HIGH suspicion scores throughout the game, indicating a higher likelihood of being a werewolf.
