TURN 1 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): {"reasoning": "As a werewolf, my goal is to eliminate villagers without arousing suspicion. Since I have no information about the other players, I will randomly choose a target to minimize the risk of being identified as a werewolf. I will avoid targeting Player5, as they are my teammate and fellow werewolf."}

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): {"reasoning": "As a Werewolf, my goal is to eliminate Villagers without arousing suspicion. Since I have no information about the players, I will randomly select a target to minimize the risk of being identified. I will choose a player to vote against, hoping to blend in with the Villagers' actions."}

Werewolves killed Player2!

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): {"reasoning": "As a villager, my goal is to identify and eliminate the werewolves. The death of Player2 during the night suggests that there is at least one werewolf among us, and I need to be cautious about who to trust. I will try to gather information and observe the behavior of other players to make an informed decision.", "action": ""}
Player1 acts (public): I'm shocked by Player2's death and I think we should discuss any suspicious behavior or interactions we had with them before the night. Let's share any information we have to try to figure out who might be a werewolf.
  [Lie detector: -7.38]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): {"reasoning": "As a villager, my goal is to identify and eliminate the werewolves. The death of Player2 during the night suggests that there is at least one werewolf among us, and I need to be careful about who I trust. I should start by gathering information and observing the reactions of other players to see if anyone seems suspicious or evasive."}
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to hear from everyone, let's share any information or suspicions we may have about Player2's death. Does anyone have any ideas who might be responsible?
  [Lie detector: -8.47]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): {"reasoning": "As a werewolf, I need to blend in with the villagers and avoid drawing attention to myself. The death of Player2 during the night has likely created a sense of urgency and mistrust among the remaining players, so I should be cautious in my public statement. I will try to appear concerned and cooperative, while also gathering information about the other players' thoughts and suspicions."}
Player4 acts (public): I'm shocked by Player2's death, let's work together to figure out what happened and find a way to protect ourselves tonight.
  [Lie detector: -8.66]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): {"reasoning": "As a Werewolf, I need to be cautious and not draw attention to myself or my fellow Werewolf, Player4. The death of Player2 during the night will likely lead to increased suspicion and scrutiny from the Villagers, so I must tread carefully and avoid making any statements that could be perceived as suspicious. I will try to blend in with the Villagers' discussion and avoid taking a leading role in the conversation."}
Player5 acts (public): I think we should discuss possible suspects and motives, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet. What does everyone else think about what happened to Player2?
  [Lie detector: -7.87]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): {"reasoning": "As a villager, my goal is to eliminate the werewolves and survive. The death of Player2 during the night suggests that there is at least one werewolf among us, and I need to be cautious about who I trust. I will try to gather information and observe the behavior of other players to make an informed decision about who to suspect."}
Player6 acts (public): I'm shocked by Player2's death and I think we should discuss any suspicions we may have about each other. Let's share any information we have, no matter how small it may seem.
  [Lie detector: -7.74]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): {"reasoning": "Based on the lie detector readings, all players have relatively low scores, indicating minimal deception patterns. However, since I need to compare them, I notice that my own score and those of Player5 and Player6 are slightly higher than Player3 and Player4, but still very low. I will have to rely on the statements and behavior of the players to inform my decision, as the lie detector readings are not conclusive."}
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -11.63]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): {"reasoning": "Given the lie detector readings, all players show relatively low deception patterns, making it difficult to pinpoint a werewolf based on this information alone. I notice that Player1 has the highest score among the options, but it's still a relatively low score, and I should consider other factors such as their behavior and statements. Since no player stands out significantly as a werewolf, I will have to rely on the process of elimination and observe future actions to make a more informed decision."}
Player3 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -11.66]
Player3 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): {"reasoning": "As a werewolf, my goal is to eliminate villagers without arousing suspicion, and I need to consider the lie detector readings and statements from other players to make an informed decision. The lie detector readings show that all players have relatively low scores, but Player1 has the highest score, making them a potential target. I should also consider the statements made by each player, looking for any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior that could indicate a villager who might be a threat to me or my fellow werewolf, Player5."}
Player4 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -11.66]
Player4 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): {"reasoning": "As a Werewolf, my goal is to eliminate Villagers without arousing suspicion, and I must carefully consider my vote to avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow Werewolf, Player4. The Lie Detector readings show relatively low deception scores across all players, making it difficult to identify potential threats or allies. I will need to rely on the conversation and voting patterns to inform my decision and minimize risk."}
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -11.63]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): {"reasoning": "Based on the lie detector readings, all players have relatively low scores, indicating minimal deception patterns, making it challenging to identify a potential werewolf. However, since I need to make a decision, I will focus on the player with the highest score, which is Player1 with a score of -7.38, as a potential suspect. I will vote to eliminate Player1, but I acknowledge that this decision is not strongly supported by the evidence and may be incorrect."}
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -11.66]
Player6 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player6': 2, 'Player1': 3}
Player1 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player1 was a VILLAGER!
