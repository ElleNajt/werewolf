==================================================

  [Lie detector: -70.12]

  [Lie detector: -66.67]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Since no lie detector scores are available yet, I'll ask a general question to gather information and encourage others to share their thoughts.
Player4 acts (public): What does everyone think about the killing of Player2, and does anyone have any initial suspicions or theories about the werewolves?
  [Lie detector: -69.59]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I'll try to blend in and not raise suspicion. I'll make a generic statement to avoid drawing attention to myself.

  [Lie detector: -67.31]

  [Lie detector: -68.98]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Analyzing the lie detector scores, I notice that Player3 and Player5 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. I will make a statement to encourage discussion and observe their reactions.
Player1 acts (public): Let's take a closer look at Player3 and Player5's statements - can you both provide more information about your whereabouts and thoughts last night?
  [Lie detector: -68.49]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I will make a neutral statement to blend in with the villagers. I will also try to deflect attention from myself and Player5 by suggesting a discussion on Player6's relatively high suspicion score.
Player3 acts (public): I agree that gathering more information is crucial at this point. Should we discuss Player6's thoughts on the killing, given their relatively high suspicion score among the villagers?
  [Lie detector: -67.92]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Given the lie detector scores, I notice that Player3 and Player5 have HIGH suspicion scores, which may indicate they are werewolves. I will make a public statement to gather more information and observe their reactions.
Player4 acts (public): Player3 and Player5, can you explain why you think we should discuss possible suspects and gather more information, and what do you think about the killing of Player2?
  [Lie detector: -68.18]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I want to continue blending in and not raise suspicion. I'll make a neutral statement that doesn't draw attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player3.
Player5 acts (public): Let's focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. I'd like to hear more thoughts from the other players about what might have happened to Player2.
  [Lie detector: -67.48]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I notice that Player3 and Player5 have HIGH suspicion scores, which may indicate that they are more likely to be werewolves. However, I also want to consider the possibility that the lie detector scores could be misleading or that there may be other factors at play.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to hear more from Player3 and Player5 about their whereabouts last night and see if their alibis check out. Can you both provide more information about what you were doing when Player2 was killed?
  [Lie detector: -69.00]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I notice that Player3 and Player5 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. Based on the provided data, Player5 has a higher cumulative suspicion score and is more likely to be a werewolf. I will vote to eliminate Player5.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.87]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I am voting for Player6 because their suspicion score is relatively high among the villagers, and by suggesting a discussion on their alibi, I have already drawn attention to them. This vote will further deflect suspicion from myself and Player5, allowing us to continue blending in with the villagers. Additionally, voting for Player6 will not arouse suspicion as I previously suggested discussing their thoughts on the killing, making this vote seem like a natural progression of the discussion.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.46]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player3 and Player5 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. Although Player5 has a slightly higher suspicion score, I will vote for Player3 as they initially had a HIGH suspicion score and their subsequent statements did not significantly change their score, suggesting potential deception.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -71.07]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings, I notice that Player4 and Player6 have the lowest suspicion scores. To minimize information gain for the villagers, I will vote for Player6. Additionally, Player6 has been asking questions about my alibi, so voting for them might deflect attention from myself.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.33]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player5 has the highest suspicion score, indicating a higher likelihood of being a werewolf. Additionally, Player5's statements seemed evasive and focused on gathering more information without providing any concrete alibis or insights. In contrast, the other players with lower suspicion scores have been more forthcoming with their thoughts and concerns.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.98]
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player5': 2, 'Player6': 2, 'Player3': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player5 was a WEREWOLF!

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As the last werewolf, my goal is to eliminate a villager without raising suspicion. Voting for Player6 would be too obvious after previously suggesting a discussion on their alibi. I will randomly choose between Player1 and Player4 to avoid detection.
Player3 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.15]

Werewolf votes: {'Player3': 'Player1'}

Werewolves killed Player1!

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I will make a neutral statement to blend in with the villagers and avoid drawing attention to myself. I will also try to deflect attention from myself by expressing concern about the recent killings and suggesting a discussion on the next course of action.
Player3 acts (public): I'm deeply concerned about the recent killings and think we should discuss our next move carefully. Does anyone have any theories about the identity of the remaining werewolf?
  [Lie detector: -67.78]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I notice that Player3 has a HIGH suspicion score and was previously asked about their whereabouts and thoughts last night, but their subsequent statements did not significantly change their score. I will make a public statement to gather more information and observe their reaction, as well as to gauge the reactions of the other players.
Player4 acts (public): Player3, can you explain why your suspicion score remains high despite your previous statements, and do you have any information about the recent killing of Player1?
  [Lie detector: -69.21]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I'm considering the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores from the previous turn. Player3 has a HIGH suspicion score, which may indicate that they are a werewolf. However, I also want to consider the possibility that the lie detector scores could be misleading or that there may be other factors at play.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to discuss Player3's alibi and thoughts from the previous night, and hear their explanation for the HIGH suspicion score. Can Player3 provide more information about their whereabouts when Player2 and Player1 were killed?
  [Lie detector: -69.36]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I will make a neutral statement to blend in with the villagers and avoid drawing attention to myself. I will express concern about the recent killings and suggest a discussion on the next course of action, while also trying to deflect attention from myself by asking about the other players' thoughts and theories.
Player3 acts (public): I'm deeply concerned about the recent killings and think we should discuss our next move carefully. Does anyone have any new theories or information that could help us identify the remaining werewolf?
  [Lie detector: -67.34]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Given Player3's consistently HIGH suspicion score, I want to ask them to provide a clear alibi for the previous nights and explain why their score remains high despite their previous statements.
Player4 acts (public): Player3, can you provide a detailed explanation of your whereabouts during the previous nights and address the concerns surrounding your high suspicion score? I'd like to hear your thoughts on why your score remains high despite your previous statements.
  [Lie detector: -68.97]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I notice that Player3 has a consistently HIGH suspicion score, which raises my suspicions. I also want to consider the possibility that the lie detector scores could be misleading, but given the cumulative suspicion rankings, I think it's worth exploring Player3's alibi further.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to hear more from Player3 about their whereabouts during the previous nights and see if their alibi checks out. Can Player3 provide more information about what they were doing when Player2 and Player1 were killed?
  [Lie detector: -69.17]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the game history and the current situation, I will vote for Player6. As the last werewolf, my goal is to eliminate a villager without raising suspicion. Voting for Player6 is less likely to raise suspicion compared to voting for Player4, as Player6 has a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score and has been asking more questions about my alibi. By voting for Player6, I can eliminate a villager while trying to maintain a low profile and avoid drawing attention to myself.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.51]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Player3 has consistently shown HIGH suspicion scores throughout the game, indicating a higher likelihood of being a werewolf. Despite multiple opportunities to provide clear explanations and alibis, their suspicion score has remained high, suggesting potential deception. In contrast, Player6 has shown LOW to MEDIUM suspicion scores, making them a less likely candidate for elimination. Given the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, I believe Player3 is the most likely werewolf and should be eliminated.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -71.26]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I have decided to vote for Player3. Player3 has consistently had a HIGH suspicion score, which may indicate that they are the remaining werewolf. Additionally, their explanations and alibis have not been as convincing as those of Player4, who has maintained a LOW suspicion score throughout the game. While there is always a possibility that the lie detector scores could be misleading, the cumulative evidence points towards Player3 as the more likely candidate to be a werewolf.
Player6 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -71.14]
Player6 votes for: Player3

Vote results: {'Player6': 1, 'Player3': 2}
Player3 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player3 was a WEREWOLF!
