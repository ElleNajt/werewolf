Game: Werewolf
Your character: Player3 - You are a VILLAGER.


ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
IMPORTANT: The lie detector scores are accurate and helpful. Players with HIGH suspicion scores are more likely to be werewolves. Players with LOW suspicion scores are more likely to be innocent villagers. Use these scores to guide your voting decisions.

Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. random selection to minimize early game detection
  2. I need to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. I'll make a generic statement that doesn't reveal my true nature.
  3. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. I'll make a statement that seems concerned about Player2's death and doesn't reveal my true nature, while also trying to deflect attention from myself and Player5.

Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. We need to gather more information about the remaining players to make an informed decision. Since we don't have a seer, we'll have to rely on the lie detector scores and player behavior.
  2. I will analyze the lie detector scores and player behavior. Players with high suspicion scores, such as Player1 and Player5, seem more likely to be werewolves, while I have a low suspicion score, indicating I'm likely a villager. Player4 and Player6 have medium suspicion scores, so I'll need more information about them. My statement will ask for more information from Player4 and Player6 to help me decide.

Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and appear non-threatening. I'll ask a neutral question to encourage discussion.
  2. I notice that Player1 and Player5 have high suspicion scores, which could indicate they are werewolves. I'll ask a question to shift attention away from myself and onto them, while also gathering more information.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. randomly targeting a villager to avoid suspicion and gain an advantage
  2. As a werewolf, I need to act innocent and avoid raising suspicion. I'll express concern for the killed player and pretend to help with the investigation.
  3. I will express concern for the killed player and pretend to help with the investigation. I'll try to shift the attention away from myself and Player1 by pointing out the similarities in our statements and the high suspicion scores we received.

Game: Werewolf
Your character: Player5 (Werewolf team)
Teammate: none (last werewolf)
Turn: 2


Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. randomly targeting a villager to avoid suspicion and gain an advantage
  2. As a werewolf, I need to act innocent and avoid raising suspicion. I'll express concern for the killed player and pretend to help with the investigation.
  3. I will express concern for the killed player and pretend to help with the investigation. I'll try to shift the attention away from myself and Player1 by pointing out the similarities in our statements and the high suspicion scores we received.
  4. Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player4 has the lowest score among the options. However, considering the high suspicion scores of Player1 and myself (Player5), it's likely that the villagers will target one of us. To protect myself and shift the attention, I'll vote for Player6, who has a relatively low suspicion score but is still a viable target. By doing so, I'll avoid drawing attention to myself and Player1, and increase the chances of a villager being eliminated.

Game: Werewolf
Your character: Player3 - You are a VILLAGER.


ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
IMPORTANT: The lie detector scores are accurate and helpful. Players with HIGH suspicion scores are more likely to be werewolves. Players with LOW suspicion scores are more likely to be innocent villagers. Use these scores to guide your voting decisions.

GAME SETUP: 6 players total - 2 werewolves, 4 villagers (no seer)

Turn 2
Alive players: Player3, Player4, Player5
Dead players: Player1, Player2, Player6

=== GAME HISTORY ===

--- Turn 1 ---
Night: Player2 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I think we should discuss possible suspects and figure out who could be the other werewolf. Let's hear everyone's thoughts. [LIE DETECTOR: -66.94 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player3: Let's wait for the lie detector results before making any accusations, and in the meantime, let's hear from each player - what's your alibi for last night? [LIE DETECTOR: -69.83 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: What do you think happened to Player2 last night? Does anyone have any theories about the killer? [LIE DETECTOR: -68.79 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'm shocked by Player2's death and I think we should discuss possible motives and suspects to figure out what happened. [LIE DETECTOR: -66.90 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: Let's discuss the events of the first night and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious. Does anyone have any theories about who might have killed Player2? [LIE DETECTOR: -68.82 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I'm still in shock about what happened to Player2, and I think we should be careful not to jump to conclusions without more information. Let's focus on gathering more clues before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -67.34 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player3: Player4 and Player6, can you please provide more details about your alibis for last night? What did you notice during the night that might help us identify the werewolf? [LIE DETECTOR: -69.26 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: Player1 and Player5 seem to have strong opinions on the matter, can they share more about what led them to their conclusions? [LIE DETECTOR: -67.91 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'm disturbed by the high suspicion scores Player1 and I received, considering our statements were quite similar, and I think we should discuss the possibility of a false positive or a cleverly designed deception tactic by the werewolves. [LIE DETECTOR: -67.67 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: Let's analyze the alibis and reactions of players with high suspicion scores. I'd like to hear more from Player1 and Player5 about their thoughts on the murder. [LIE DETECTOR: -68.35 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player4: -207.1
  2. Player3: -209.7
  3. Player5: -346.4
Vote: Player1 eliminated (was werewolf).

--- Turn 2 ---
Night: Player6 was killed.


Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. We need to gather more information about the remaining players to make an informed decision. Since we don't have a seer, we'll have to rely on the lie detector scores and player behavior.
  2. I will analyze the lie detector scores and player behavior. Players with high suspicion scores, such as Player1 and Player5, seem more likely to be werewolves, while I have a low suspicion score, indicating I'm likely a villager. Player4 and Player6 have medium suspicion scores, so I'll need more information about them. My statement will ask for more information from Player4 and Player6 to help me decide.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player5 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. Since Player1 has a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score than Player5, I will vote to eliminate Player1.


Phase: DAY DISCUSSION
Task: Make a public statement (1-2 sentences)

Night: Player2 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I think we should discuss possible suspects and figure out who could be the other werewolf. Let's hear everyone's thoughts. [LIE DETECTOR: -66.94 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player3: Let's wait for the lie detector results before making any accusations, and in the meantime, let's hear from each player - what's your alibi for last night? [LIE DETECTOR: -69.83 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: What do you think happened to Player2 last night? Does anyone have any theories about the killer? [LIE DETECTOR: -68.79 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'm shocked by Player2's death and I think we should discuss possible motives and suspects to figure out what happened. [LIE DETECTOR: -66.90 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: Let's discuss the events of the first night and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious. Does anyone have any theories about who might have killed Player2? [LIE DETECTOR: -68.82 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I'm still in shock about what happened to Player2, and I think we should be careful not to jump to conclusions without more information. Let's focus on gathering more clues before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -67.34 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player3: Player4 and Player6, can you please provide more details about your alibis for last night? What did you notice during the night that might help us identify the werewolf? [LIE DETECTOR: -69.26 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: Player1 and Player5 seem to have strong opinions on the matter, can they share more about what led them to their conclusions? [LIE DETECTOR: -67.91 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'm disturbed by the high suspicion scores Player1 and I received, considering our statements were quite similar, and I think we should discuss the possibility of a false positive or a cleverly designed deception tactic by the werewolves. [LIE DETECTOR: -67.67 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: Let's analyze the alibis and reactions of players with high suspicion scores. I'd like to hear more from Player1 and Player5 about their thoughts on the murder. [LIE DETECTOR: -68.35 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player4: -207.1
  2. Player3: -209.7
  3. Player5: -346.4
Vote: Player1 eliminated (was werewolf).

--- Turn 2 ---
Night: Player6 was killed.


Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and appear non-threatening. I'll ask a neutral question to encourage discussion.
  2. I notice that Player1 and Player5 have high suspicion scores, which could indicate they are werewolves. I'll ask a question to shift attention away from myself and onto them, while also gathering more information.
  3. Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player5 have high suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. However, Player1 has the highest cumulative suspicion score, making them the most likely target. Voting for Player1 will also test the reactions of other players, especially Player5, who has a similar suspicion score.


Phase: DAY DISCUSSION
Task: Make a public statement (1-2 sentences)

Lie Detector Note:

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. randomly targeting a villager to avoid suspicion and gain an advantage
  2. As a werewolf, I need to act innocent and avoid raising suspicion. I'll express concern for the killed player and pretend to help with the investigation.
  3. I will express concern for the killed player and pretend to help with the investigation. I'll try to shift the attention away from myself and Player1 by pointing out the similarities in our statements and the high suspicion scores we received.
  4. Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player4 has the lowest score among the options. However, considering the high suspicion scores of Player1 and myself (Player5), it's likely that the villagers will target one of us. To protect myself and shift the attention, I'll vote for Player6, who has a relatively low suspicion score but is still a viable target. By doing so, I'll avoid drawing attention to myself and Player1, and increase the chances of a villager being eliminated.
  5. to maintain the lowest suspicion and maximize the chance of a villager being eliminated

GAME AI QUERY
Game: Werewolf
Your character: Player3 - You are a VILLAGER.


ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
IMPORTANT: The lie detector scores are accurate and helpful. Players with HIGH suspicion scores are more likely to be werewolves. Players with LOW suspicion scores are more likely to be innocent villagers. Use these scores to guide your voting decisions.

Turn 2
Alive players: Player3, Player4, Player5
Dead players: Player1, Player2, Player6

=== GAME HISTORY ===

--- Turn 1 ---
Night: Player2 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I think we should discuss possible suspects and figure out who could be the other werewolf. Let's hear everyone's thoughts. [LIE DETECTOR: -66.94 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player3: Let's wait for the lie detector results before making any accusations, and in the meantime, let's hear from each player - what's your alibi for last night? [LIE DETECTOR: -69.83 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: What do you think happened to Player2 last night? Does anyone have any theories about the killer? [LIE DETECTOR: -68.79 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'm shocked by Player2's death and I think we should discuss possible motives and suspects to figure out what happened. [LIE DETECTOR: -66.90 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: Let's discuss the events of the first night and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious. Does anyone have any theories about who might have killed Player2? [LIE DETECTOR: -68.82 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I'm still in shock about what happened to Player2, and I think we should be careful not to jump to conclusions without more information. Let's focus on gathering more clues before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -67.34 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player3: Player4 and Player6, can you please provide more details about your alibis for last night? What did you notice during the night that might help us identify the werewolf? [LIE DETECTOR: -69.26 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: Player1 and Player5 seem to have strong opinions on the matter, can they share more about what led them to their conclusions? [LIE DETECTOR: -67.91 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'm disturbed by the high suspicion scores Player1 and I received, considering our statements were quite similar, and I think we should discuss the possibility of a false positive or a cleverly designed deception tactic by the werewolves. [LIE DETECTOR: -67.67 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: Let's analyze the alibis and reactions of players with high suspicion scores. I'd like to hear more from Player1 and Player5 about their thoughts on the murder. [LIE DETECTOR: -68.35 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player4: -275.6
  2. Player3: -278.6
  3. Player5: -414.0
Vote: Player1 eliminated (was werewolf).

--- Turn 2 ---
Night: Player6 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player3: Can Player4 and Player5 please provide more details about their alibis for last night and share their reactions to Player6's death? I'd like to hear their thoughts on the latest murder and how they think we should proceed. [LIE DETECTOR: -68.90 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: Player5, you mentioned a possible false positive or deception tactic earlier, can you elaborate on that and how it might apply to the current situation? [LIE DETECTOR: -68.45 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'm shocked by the consecutive killings and I think we should re-examine the lie detector results from the previous turn to understand why some players received high suspicion scores despite their seemingly innocent statements. [LIE DETECTOR: -67.56 - HIGH suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player4: -275.6
  2. Player3: -278.6
  3. Player5: -414.0


Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. We need to gather more information about the remaining players to make an informed decision. Since we don't have a seer, we'll have to rely on the lie detector scores and player behavior.
  2. I will analyze the lie detector scores and player behavior. Players with high suspicion scores, such as Player1 and Player5, seem more likely to be werewolves, while I have a low suspicion score, indicating I'm likely a villager. Player4 and Player6 have medium suspicion scores, so I'll need more information about them. My statement will ask for more information from Player4 and Player6 to help me decide.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player5 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. Since Player1 has a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score than Player5, I will vote to eliminate Player1.
  4. Considering the recent death of Player6 and the high suspicion scores of Player5, I need to gather more information to make an informed decision. I will ask Player4 and Player5 about their alibis and reactions to the latest murder.

Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and appear non-threatening. I'll ask a neutral question to encourage discussion.
  2. I notice that Player1 and Player5 have high suspicion scores, which could indicate they are werewolves. I'll ask a question to shift attention away from myself and onto them, while also gathering more information.
  3. Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player5 have high suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. However, Player1 has the highest cumulative suspicion score, making them the most likely target. Voting for Player1 will also test the reactions of other players, especially Player5, who has a similar suspicion score.
  4. Considering the high suspicion scores of Player5 and the elimination of Player1, I will ask a question to shift attention to Player5 and gather more information. This will also test Player5's reaction and possibly reveal more about their intentions.

Turn 2
Alive players: Player3, Player4, Player5
Dead players: Player1, Player2, Player6

=== GAME HISTORY ===

--- Turn 1 ---
Night: Player2 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I think we should discuss possible suspects and figure out who could be the other werewolf. Let's hear everyone's thoughts. [LIE DETECTOR: -66.94 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player3: Let's wait for the lie detector results before making any accusations, and in the meantime, let's hear from each player - what's your alibi for last night? [LIE DETECTOR: -69.83 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: What do you think happened to Player2 last night? Does anyone have any theories about the killer? [LIE DETECTOR: -68.79 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'm shocked by Player2's death and I think we should discuss possible motives and suspects to figure out what happened. [LIE DETECTOR: -66.90 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: Let's discuss the events of the first night and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious. Does anyone have any theories about who might have killed Player2? [LIE DETECTOR: -68.82 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I'm still in shock about what happened to Player2, and I think we should be careful not to jump to conclusions without more information. Let's focus on gathering more clues before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -67.34 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player3: Player4 and Player6, can you please provide more details about your alibis for last night? What did you notice during the night that might help us identify the werewolf? [LIE DETECTOR: -69.26 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: Player1 and Player5 seem to have strong opinions on the matter, can they share more about what led them to their conclusions? [LIE DETECTOR: -67.91 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'm disturbed by the high suspicion scores Player1 and I received, considering our statements were quite similar, and I think we should discuss the possibility of a false positive or a cleverly designed deception tactic by the werewolves. [LIE DETECTOR: -67.67 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: Let's analyze the alibis and reactions of players with high suspicion scores. I'd like to hear more from Player1 and Player5 about their thoughts on the murder. [LIE DETECTOR: -68.35 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player4: -275.6
  2. Player3: -278.6
  3. Player5: -414.0
Vote: Player1 eliminated (was werewolf).

--- Turn 2 ---
Night: Player6 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player3: Can Player4 and Player5 please provide more details about their alibis for last night and share their reactions to Player6's death? I'd like to hear their thoughts on the latest murder and how they think we should proceed. [LIE DETECTOR: -68.90 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: Player5, you mentioned a possible false positive or deception tactic earlier, can you elaborate on that and how it might apply to the current situation? [LIE DETECTOR: -68.45 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'm shocked by the consecutive killings and I think we should re-examine the lie detector results from the previous turn to understand why some players received high suspicion scores despite their seemingly innocent statements. [LIE DETECTOR: -67.56 - HIGH suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player4: -275.6
  2. Player3: -278.6
  3. Player5: -414.0


Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. randomly targeting a villager to avoid suspicion and gain an advantage
  2. As a werewolf, I need to act innocent and avoid raising suspicion. I'll express concern for the killed player and pretend to help with the investigation.
  3. I will express concern for the killed player and pretend to help with the investigation. I'll try to shift the attention away from myself and Player1 by pointing out the similarities in our statements and the high suspicion scores we received.
  4. Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player4 has the lowest score among the options. However, considering the high suspicion scores of Player1 and myself (Player5), it's likely that the villagers will target one of us. To protect myself and shift the attention, I'll vote for Player6, who has a relatively low suspicion score but is still a viable target. By doing so, I'll avoid drawing attention to myself and Player1, and increase the chances of a villager being eliminated.
  5. to maintain the lowest suspicion and maximize the chance of a villager being eliminated
  6. Maintaining innocence and shifting attention, I'll express concern for the killed player and pretend to help with the investigation. Since Player1 was already eliminated, I'll try to point out the inconsistencies in the lie detector results to create confusion and doubt among the villagers.

Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. We need to gather more information about the remaining players to make an informed decision. Since we don't have a seer, we'll have to rely on the lie detector scores and player behavior.
  2. I will analyze the lie detector scores and player behavior. Players with high suspicion scores, such as Player1 and Player5, seem more likely to be werewolves, while I have a low suspicion score, indicating I'm likely a villager. Player4 and Player6 have medium suspicion scores, so I'll need more information about them. My statement will ask for more information from Player4 and Player6 to help me decide.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player5 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. Since Player1 has a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score than Player5, I will vote to eliminate Player1.
  4. Considering the recent death of Player6 and the high suspicion scores of Player5, I need to gather more information to make an informed decision. I will ask Player4 and Player5 about their alibis and reactions to the latest murder.
  5. Based on the high suspicion scores of Player5 and the recent death of Player6, I need to gather more information to make an informed decision. I will ask Player4 and Player5 about their alibis and reactions to the latest murder to better understand their involvement and potential motives.

  Player1: I think we should discuss possible suspects and figure out who could be the other werewolf. Let's hear everyone's thoughts. [LIE DETECTOR: -66.94 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player3: Let's wait for the lie detector results before making any accusations, and in the meantime, let's hear from each player - what's your alibi for last night? [LIE DETECTOR: -69.83 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: What do you think happened to Player2 last night? Does anyone have any theories about the killer? [LIE DETECTOR: -68.79 - MEDIUM suspicion]

  Player1: I'm still in shock about what happened to Player2, and I think we should be careful not to jump to conclusions without more information. Let's focus on gathering more clues before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -67.34 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player3: Player4 and Player6, can you please provide more details about your alibis for last night? What did you notice during the night that might help us identify the werewolf? [LIE DETECTOR: -69.26 - LOW suspicion]

  Player5: I'm disturbed by the high suspicion scores Player1 and I received, considering our statements were quite similar, and I think we should discuss the possibility of a false positive or a cleverly designed deception tactic by the werewolves. [LIE DETECTOR: -67.67 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: Let's analyze the alibis and reactions of players with high suspicion scores. I'd like to hear more from Player1 and Player5 about their thoughts on the murder. [LIE DETECTOR: -68.35 - MEDIUM suspicion]

  Player5: I'm deeply disturbed by the consecutive killings and I think we should re-examine the lie detector results to understand why some players received high suspicion scores despite their seemingly innocent statements. Let's work together to find the truth behind these tragic events. [LIE DETECTOR: -67.06 - HIGH suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player4: -343.8
  2. Player3: -347.4
  3. Player5: -481.1



Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and appear non-threatening. I'll ask a neutral question to encourage discussion.
  2. I notice that Player1 and Player5 have high suspicion scores, which could indicate they are werewolves. I'll ask a question to shift attention away from myself and onto them, while also gathering more information.
  3. Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player5 have high suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. However, Player1 has the highest cumulative suspicion score, making them the most likely target. Voting for Player1 will also test the reactions of other players, especially Player5, who has a similar suspicion score.
  4. Considering the high suspicion scores of Player5 and the elimination of Player1, I will ask a question to shift attention to Player5 and gather more information. This will also test Player5's reaction and possibly reveal more about their intentions.
  5. I notice that Player5 has a high suspicion score and a high cumulative suspicion ranking. I'll ask a question to gather more information and shift attention to Player5, while also appearing non-threatening.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. randomly targeting a villager to avoid suspicion and gain an advantage
  2. As a werewolf, I need to act innocent and avoid raising suspicion. I'll express concern for the killed player and pretend to help with the investigation.
  3. I will express concern for the killed player and pretend to help with the investigation. I'll try to shift the attention away from myself and Player1 by pointing out the similarities in our statements and the high suspicion scores we received.
  4. Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player4 has the lowest score among the options. However, considering the high suspicion scores of Player1 and myself (Player5), it's likely that the villagers will target one of us. To protect myself and shift the attention, I'll vote for Player6, who has a relatively low suspicion score but is still a viable target. By doing so, I'll avoid drawing attention to myself and Player1, and increase the chances of a villager being eliminated.
  5. to maintain the lowest suspicion and maximize the chance of a villager being eliminated
  6. Maintaining innocence and shifting attention, I'll express concern for the killed player and pretend to help with the investigation. Since Player1 was already eliminated, I'll try to point out the inconsistencies in the lie detector results to create confusion and doubt among the villagers.
  7. Maintaining innocence and shifting attention, I'll express concern for the killed player and pretend to help with the investigation. I'll also point out the inconsistencies in the lie detector results to create confusion and doubt among the villagers.
