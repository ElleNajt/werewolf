--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I need to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. I'll make a generic statement that doesn't reveal my true nature.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should discuss possible suspects and figure out who could be the other werewolf. Let's hear everyone's thoughts.
  [Lie detector: -66.94]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): We need to gather more information about the remaining players to make an informed decision. Since we don't have a seer, we'll have to rely on the lie detector scores and player behavior.
Player3 acts (public): Let's wait for the lie detector results before making any accusations, and in the meantime, let's hear from each player - what's your alibi for last night?
  [Lie detector: -69.83]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gather information and appear non-threatening. I'll ask a neutral question to encourage discussion.
Player4 acts (public): What do you think happened to Player2 last night? Does anyone have any theories about the killer?
  [Lie detector: -68.79]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to act innocent and avoid raising suspicion. I'll express concern for the killed player and pretend to help with the investigation.
Player5 acts (public): I'm shocked by Player2's death and I think we should discuss possible motives and suspects to figure out what happened.
  [Lie detector: -66.90]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gather information and identify potential werewolves. Since no lie detector results are available yet, I will make a neutral statement to encourage discussion.
Player6 acts (public): Let's discuss the events of the first night and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious. Does anyone have any theories about who might have killed Player2?
  [Lie detector: -68.82]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. I'll make a statement that seems concerned about Player2's death and doesn't reveal my true nature, while also trying to deflect attention from myself and Player5.
Player1 acts (public): I'm still in shock about what happened to Player2, and I think we should be careful not to jump to conclusions without more information. Let's focus on gathering more clues before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -67.34]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): I will analyze the lie detector scores and player behavior. Players with high suspicion scores, such as Player1 and Player5, seem more likely to be werewolves, while I have a low suspicion score, indicating I'm likely a villager. Player4 and Player6 have medium suspicion scores, so I'll need more information about them. My statement will ask for more information from Player4 and Player6 to help me decide.
Player3 acts (public): Player4 and Player6, can you please provide more details about your alibis for last night? What did you notice during the night that might help us identify the werewolf?
  [Lie detector: -69.26]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I notice that Player1 and Player5 have high suspicion scores, which could indicate they are werewolves. I'll ask a question to shift attention away from myself and onto them, while also gathering more information.
Player4 acts (public): Player1 and Player5 seem to have strong opinions on the matter, can they share more about what led them to their conclusions?
  [Lie detector: -67.91]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): I will express concern for the killed player and pretend to help with the investigation. I'll try to shift the attention away from myself and Player1 by pointing out the similarities in our statements and the high suspicion scores we received.
Player5 acts (public): I'm disturbed by the high suspicion scores Player1 and I received, considering our statements were quite similar, and I think we should discuss the possibility of a false positive or a cleverly designed deception tactic by the werewolves.
  [Lie detector: -67.67]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Considering the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player5 have high suspicion scores, which may indicate they are werewolves. I will make a statement to encourage discussion and observe their reactions.
Player6 acts (public): Let's analyze the alibis and reactions of players with high suspicion scores. I'd like to hear more from Player1 and Player5 about their thoughts on the murder.
  [Lie detector: -68.35]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I will vote to eliminate Player4, as they have the highest cumulative suspicion score among the villagers and voting for them will help to deflect attention from myself and Player5. Additionally, eliminating a villager will also reduce the number of potential threats to us werewolves.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -69.95]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player5 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. Since Player1 has a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score than Player5, I will vote to eliminate Player1.
Player3 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.65]
Player3 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player5 have high suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. However, Player1 has the highest cumulative suspicion score, making them the most likely target. Voting for Player1 will also test the reactions of other players, especially Player5, who has a similar suspicion score.
Player4 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.42]
Player4 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player4 has the lowest score among the options. However, considering the high suspicion scores of Player1 and myself (Player5), it's likely that the villagers will target one of us. To protect myself and shift the attention, I'll vote for Player6, who has a relatively low suspicion score but is still a viable target. By doing so, I'll avoid drawing attention to myself and Player1, and increase the chances of a villager being eliminated.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.73]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player5 have high suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. However, considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1 and Player5 are closely ranked, but Player1 has a slightly lower cumulative suspicion score. I will vote for Player1 due to the slightly higher suspicion score in the discussion phase and the initial reaction statement.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.30]
Player6 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player4': 1, 'Player1': 3, 'Player6': 1}
Player1 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player1 was a WEREWOLF!

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE

Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.82]

Werewolves killed Player6!

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Considering the recent death of Player6 and the high suspicion scores of Player5, I need to gather more information to make an informed decision. I will ask Player4 and Player5 about their alibis and reactions to the latest murder.
Player3 acts (public): Can Player4 and Player5 please provide more details about their alibis for last night and share their reactions to Player6's death? I'd like to hear their thoughts on the latest murder and how they think we should proceed.
  [Lie detector: -68.90]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Considering the high suspicion scores of Player5 and the elimination of Player1, I will ask a question to shift attention to Player5 and gather more information. This will also test Player5's reaction and possibly reveal more about their intentions.
Player4 acts (public): Player5, you mentioned a possible false positive or deception tactic earlier, can you elaborate on that and how it might apply to the current situation?
  [Lie detector: -68.45]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Maintaining innocence and shifting attention, I'll express concern for the killed player and pretend to help with the investigation. Since Player1 was already eliminated, I'll try to point out the inconsistencies in the lie detector results to create confusion and doubt among the villagers.
Player5 acts (public): I'm shocked by the consecutive killings and I think we should re-examine the lie detector results from the previous turn to understand why some players received high suspicion scores despite their seemingly innocent statements.
  [Lie detector: -67.56]

  [Lie detector: -68.72]

  [Lie detector: -67.06]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player5 has a significantly higher suspicion score than Player4, indicating a higher likelihood of being a werewolf. Additionally, Player5's recent statements have high suspicion scores, further increasing the likelihood of deception. Given the recent death of Player6 and the need to eliminate a potential werewolf, I will vote to eliminate Player5.
Player3 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.95]
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the recent discussion, Player5 has a significantly higher cumulative suspicion score and has received high suspicion scores consistently. This suggests a higher likelihood of Player5 being a werewolf. Voting for Player5 is the most logical choice to protect the village.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.90]
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player3 has a lower score than Player4, but not by much. However, considering my goal as a werewolf is to eliminate villagers, I will vote for the player with the lower suspicion score, increasing the chances of a villager being eliminated. Additionally, Player3's questions and requests for alibis indicate a more active role in the investigation, making them a more significant threat to my survival.
Player5 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -70.08]
Player5 votes for: Player3

Vote results: {'Player5': 2, 'Player3': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 2 votes!
