Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to gather information and build trust with the other villagers. Since Player6 is dead, I'll make a statement to encourage the group to discuss and share information.
  2. As a villager, I want to encourage open discussion and sharing of information to help uncover the truth behind Player6's death. By doing so, we can build trust and gather clues to identify potential threats within our group.
  3. As a villager, I need to eliminate a player who might be suspicious or has a high likelihood of being a werewolf. Based on the discussion, no one has made any aggressive or suspicious statements. However, Player5 seems to be focusing on building trust and common ground, which could be a good thing, but it's also a common tactic used by werewolves to gain the villagers' trust.
  4. As a villager, I want to encourage open discussion and sharing of information to help uncover the truth behind Player6's death and potentially identify potential threats within our group. I believe discussing the circumstances surrounding Player4's death will be crucial in understanding the situation and making informed decisions for the future.
