  Player3: I think we should discuss the possibility of Player5 being involved in Player1's murder, as they seemed a bit evasive in their previous statement.
  Player4: Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player1 and ensure our safety. We should focus on gathering information without jumping to conclusions.
  Player5: I think we should focus on finding a balance between gathering information and not revealing too much about ourselves, so we can make informed decisions later.
  Player6: Let's focus on gathering information and discussing the events of the previous night, while keeping a close eye on any suspicious behavior.




Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my priority is to gather information and avoid suspicion. Given that Player1 was killed on the first night, it's likely that at least one werewolf was among the night's events.
  2. As a villager, I need to appear cautious and not reveal too much about myself. I also want to encourage discussion and questioning of the other players.
