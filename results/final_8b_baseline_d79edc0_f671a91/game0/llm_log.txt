  Player6: I suggest we all be cautious and discuss any potential threats carefully, as we don't know who might be a werewolf.
  Player1: Let's focus on discussing the events from last night and gathering information about Player2's death without directly pointing fingers at any specific player.
  Player3: I, Player3, suggest we all share any information we might have about the events of the previous night, as it could help us better understand what happened to Player2 and potentially identify any suspicious behavior.
  Player4: I think we should focus on gathering information about Player2's death and discuss possible motives behind it.
  Player5: Let's discuss the last night's events and see if anyone has any information about who might have targeted Player2. Perhaps we can find some clues about the werewolves' identities.
  Player6: Let's all be cautious and share any information we have about Player2's death, as it might help us figure out what's going on and keep each other safe.




Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Since Player2 is dead, I should express concern for the safety of the remaining players and suggest caution in our discussion.
  2. Given the recent death of Player2, I want to express my concern for the safety of the remaining players and encourage them to share any information they might have about the incident.
