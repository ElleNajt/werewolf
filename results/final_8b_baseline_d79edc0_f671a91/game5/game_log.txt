==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Initial vote to test the waters, avoid raising suspicion, and shift focus away from Player3. Voting for Player4 will allow me to gather more information and observe the reactions of the other players.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I need to eliminate a player who is not a werewolf, and also make sure not to raise any suspicions about myself. I will analyze the statements made by the players and look for any inconsistencies or behaviors that could indicate a werewolf. Based on the discussion, Player1 seems to be taking a neutral stance, but they are also the fellow werewolf. Player4 seems cautious and wants to gather more information, which could be a sign of a werewolf trying to blend in. Player5 and Player6 are proposing to discuss the night's events and gather clues, which seems like a reasonable approach.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to eliminate a player who may be suspicious or has shown unusual behavior. Based on the discussion, no one has explicitly accused anyone, but Player5's suggestion to discuss roles and behaviors during the night could be a sign of trying to gather information without being too obvious. Additionally, Player5's proposal seems like a reasonable way to gather information, but it could also be a ploy to deflect attention from themselves.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I will vote for Player3 as they seem to be focusing on finding out who was involved in Player2's death, which could be a suspicious behavior for a werewolf. Their actions may be seen as trying to uncover clues, but it could also be a clever ploy to distract from their own involvement.
Player5 acts (public): Player3
Player5 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the discussion, it seems that Player1 and Player3 are taking a more proactive approach to investigating Player2's death, which could be a sign of a villager trying to uncover the truth. However, it's also possible that they could be werewolves trying to blend in. I will choose to vote for Player4 as they seem to be taking a more cautious approach, which could be a sign of a villager trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves.
Player6 acts (public): Player4
Player6 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player4': 3, 'Player5': 1, 'Player3': 1}
Player4 is eliminated with 3 votes!
