Player4, Player5, and Player6 are all suggesting that we gather more information, which is a good approach, but we can't wait indefinitely. Player6 is the newest player, and we don't know much about their motives or behavior yet. Player2, Player4, Player5 are all part of the initial discussion, but we can't eliminate them yet."
