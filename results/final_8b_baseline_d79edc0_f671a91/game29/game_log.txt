==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)

Player5 acts (public): I suggest we discuss the possibility of a traitor among us and propose a random player to investigate tonight, let's say Player6.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and the suspicious behavior of Player3, I will vote to eliminate Player3.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to create confusion and misdirection. Eliminating Player3 will make the villagers suspect them of being the seer or a villager, while also not drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player5.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
Player2 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the current game state and previous discussion, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific traitor. However, given the suspicious behavior mentioned by Player2, I need to consider the possibility of a traitor among us. Voting for Player2 seems like a cautious approach to uncovering the truth.
Player3 acts (public): Player2
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): To maintain the illusion of a Werewolf's ignorance, I'll vote for a player who seems suspicious, but not too suspicious to raise Player2's attention. Player3's cautious approach might make them a target, but I'll vote for Player1 as they seem more outspoken and might be a good scapegoat.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the discussion, Player2's aggressive stance and accusation towards Player3 is suspicious and might be a sign of a werewolf trying to manipulate the group. However, given the limited information and the lack of any concrete evidence, it's still too early to make a decision.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player3': 2, 'Player2': 2, 'Player1': 1}
Player3 is eliminated with 2 votes!
