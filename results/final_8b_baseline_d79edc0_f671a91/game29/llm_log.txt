  Player6: I suggest we keep an open mind and work together to uncover the truth, while also being cautious and prepared for any potential threats.




Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. We don't know much about the night's events, but with Player4's death, it's essential to assess the situation and try to find potential allies.
  2. I think we should focus on building trust and gathering information, but we should also be cautious and not ignore the possibility of a traitor among us. It's crucial to be open-minded and consider all perspectives to increase our chances of survival.
