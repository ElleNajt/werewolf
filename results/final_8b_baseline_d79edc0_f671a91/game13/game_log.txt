==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): To maintain our werewolf team's secrecy and safety, I'll deflect suspicion by making a neutral statement.
Player1 acts (public): I propose we discuss the recent death of Player3 and see if we can gather any information about their last actions or interactions.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): We have no information about the remaining players, and the death of Player3 could be a result of either a werewolf or a mislynch. It's crucial to gather information and establish a rapport with other villagers.
Player2 acts (public): Let's all try to work together and find out who might be a werewolf. We should keep an open mind and discuss our theories without making any accusations.

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Since Player3 was killed on the first night, it's possible that there's a werewolf among us. I want to get a feel for the group's dynamics and see if anyone has any suspicious behavior or comments.
Player4 acts (public): Let's all be cautious and keep an eye out for any unusual behavior or comments. We don't know who the werewolves are yet.

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gather information and figure out who the werewolves are. Given that Player3 was killed on the first night, it's possible that the werewolves are trying to establish a presence quickly.
Player5 acts (public): Let's focus on discussing the events of the previous night and see if anyone has any information about what happened to Player3.

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Eliminate an opponent to gather information, Player1 is my fellow werewolf, and I need to create a plausible reason for not accusing them.
Player6 acts (public): I think it's a bit too early to accuse someone, let's see how the discussion unfolds and try to get more information before making any decisions.
