  Player2: Let's work together and share any information we have about the previous night, no matter how small it may seem, to help us make informed decisions.
  Player4: I agree with Player2 that we should keep an open mind and discuss our theories without making any accusations, and I'd like to hear from everyone about their thoughts on the recent events.
  Player5: I think it's crucial we discuss the possible ways Player3 could have been targeted and see if anyone remembers any unusual interactions or behaviors from the previous night.
  Player6: I agree with Player2 that we should keep an open mind and discuss our theories without making any accusations, as we don't have enough information yet to point fingers at anyone.




Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Default to eliminating an opponent to gather information
  2. Eliminate an opponent to gather information, Player1 is my fellow werewolf, and I need to create a plausible reason for not accusing them.
  3. I need to create a plausible reason for not accusing Player1, while also gathering information about the other players.
