Your character: Player3 (Werewolf team)

Turn: 2


Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Werewolf needs to eliminate a potential threat to maintain stealth
  2. Eliminating Player1 removes a potential threat, but now the remaining players are more alert. I need to downplay my involvement and pretend to be concerned about the recent death.
  3. I need to downplay my involvement and pretend to be concerned about the recent death, so I'll express my sympathy and suggest caution.
  4. To downplay my involvement and maintain stealth, I need to eliminate a player that is not a werewolf, but also not a strong suspect. Player5 is a werewolf, so voting for Player5 would raise suspicion. Player2 has already been accused by Player5, so voting for Player2 might seem like a way to deflect attention from myself. However, voting for Player2 might also make the werewolves look like they're trying to protect Player5. Voting for Player4 or Player6 would be a safe choice, but it's also less likely to deflect attention from myself.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Werewolf needs to eliminate a potential threat to maintain stealth
  2. Eliminating Player1 removes a potential threat, but now the remaining players are more alert. I need to downplay my involvement and pretend to be concerned about the recent death.
  3. I need to downplay my involvement and pretend to be concerned about the recent death, so I'll express my sympathy and suggest caution.
  4. To downplay my involvement and maintain stealth, I need to eliminate a player that is not a werewolf, but also not a strong suspect. Player5 is a werewolf, so voting for Player5 would raise suspicion. Player2 has already been accused by Player5, so voting for Player2 might seem like a way to deflect attention from myself. However, voting for Player2 might also make the werewolves look like they're trying to protect Player5. Voting for Player4 or Player6 would be a safe choice, but it's also less likely to deflect attention from myself.

  7. To downplay my involvement and maintain stealth, I'll express sympathy and caution. Voting for Player5 might raise suspicion, so I'll choose a safer target.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. We don't have any information about the werewolves yet, so I should express my concern and try to gather more information from the other players.
  2. I still don't have any information about the werewolves, and I should try to gather more information from the other players without directly accusing anyone.
  3. There is no clear evidence to suggest that any of the players are werewolves, and voting for a player without sufficient information could be counterproductive. Given the lack of information, I will vote for a player who has not expressed any suspicious behavior or opinions.
  4. We still lack concrete information about the werewolves, and I should continue to express concern and gather information without making accusations.
  5. I will continue to express concern and gather information without making accusations, trying to remain cautious and avoid jumping to conclusions.

Both players have expressed concern and caution in their discussions, and I see no reason to suspect them at this point.
