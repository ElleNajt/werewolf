--- LLM RESPONSE ---
{"reasoning": "Based on the initial discussion, I don't see any direct evidence pointing to a specific player as a werewolf. Player3's behavior was questioned, but it's essential to keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions. Since we don't have any concrete information, I'll vote based on the fact that I want to keep the group's dynamics open and encourage continued discussion. I'll vote to eliminate Player1, as their comment about keeping an eye on Player3 could be seen as accusatory, and I'd like to see more collaboration and less finger-pointing.", "action": "Player1"}
