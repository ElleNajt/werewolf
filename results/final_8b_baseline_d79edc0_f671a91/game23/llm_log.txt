  1. It's the first day and we don't know much about the other players, so I'll keep my statement simple and try to get some information out of them.
  2. It's the first day and we don't know much about the other players, so I'll keep my statement simple and try to get some information out of them.
  3. Based on the discussion, Player6 seems to be cautious and doesn't want to jump to conclusions. However, Player1 proposed investigating Player6's behavior, and Player4 agreed with this proposal. Considering that Player6 was alive during the first night, I'd like to vote for Player6 to see if they show any signs of being a werewolf.
  4. Based on the events of the first night and the discussion, I believe we should focus on gathering more information about Player6's behavior, given their cautious approach and the fact that they were alive during the first night. I'd like to ask Player6 to share any details they might have about their actions and movements during the night when Player2 was killed.
  5. I want to keep the discussion focused on gathering information about Player6's behavior, as they seem cautious and might be hiding something.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. initial strategy, eliminate the most visible player
  2. As a Werewolf, I must blend in with the villagers and avoid drawing attention to myself. My initial strategy is to appear neutral and gain the trust of the other players.
  3. As a Werewolf, my priority is to maintain a neutral image and avoid suspicion. I will make a statement that suggests we should focus on the facts and not jump to conclusions.
  4. voting for a villager to eliminate, while also considering the presence of another werewolf, Player4, and the need to maintain a neutral image.
  5. avoiding suspicion and eliminating a potential threat to the werewolf team
  6. As a Werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral image and avoid suspicion, so I will make a statement that focuses on the facts and encourages the group to remain calm and objective.
  7. As a werewolf, I must continue to blend in with the villagers and avoid drawing attention to myself. I will make a statement that encourages the group to focus on gathering concrete evidence and discussing the facts surrounding Player3's death.
