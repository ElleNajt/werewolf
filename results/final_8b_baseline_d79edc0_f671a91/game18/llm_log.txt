  2. I want to build trust and show my concern for the group without revealing too much, so I'll make a friendly and non-committal statement.
  3. No clear evidence points to any player being a werewolf, but Player4's repeated questioning of Player5's involvement raises suspicions. To avoid being targeted by the werewolves, I'll vote for Player4.

Player2 has been actively participating in the discussion and has proposed several ideas, which could be a sign of a werewolf trying to blend in.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Initially, I'll choose a random player to eliminate to maintain a balance and keep my true identity hidden.
  2. Maintaining a neutral tone to avoid suspicion, and assessing the remaining players to identify potential werewolves.
  3. Maintaining a neutral tone to avoid suspicion, and assessing the remaining players to identify potential werewolves. I'll express a sense of caution without directly pointing to any player.
  4. Based on the discussion, Player4's suspicious comments about Player5's lack of involvement in the events of last night and their proposal to investigate Player5, suggests that Player4 may be a potential werewolf. As a fellow werewolf, it's essential to eliminate a player who may raise suspicion and potentially expose our pack.
  5. Protect potential werewolf pack and avoid suspicion, eliminate Player2 who has not made any suspicious comments and seems less likely to be a werewolf.
  6. Maintaining a neutral tone to avoid suspicion, and assessing the remaining players to identify potential werewolves. I'll express a sense of caution without directly pointing to any player.
