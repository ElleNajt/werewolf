==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the game history, I have been cautious and open to forming alliances. Player3 has shown a similar approach to mine, discussing strategies and keeping an open mind. Player6, on the other hand, has been more focused on reflection and community well-being, which seems less suspicious. However, considering the recent death of Player5, I need to consider the possibility of a werewolf among us. Player3 has been discussing strategies and seems more proactive, which could be a sign of a werewolf trying to blend in. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player3.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
Player2 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to eliminate a player who may be a werewolf while also being cautious not to accuse an innocent player. Player2 has been actively participating in the discussion and has proposed several ideas, which could be a sign of a werewolf trying to blend in. On the other hand, Player6 has been relatively quiet and has not made any suspicious statements. Considering the information available, I will vote to eliminate Player2.
Player3 acts (public): Player2
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to eliminate a player who is not a threat to my pack. Player3 has been cautious and neutral in their comments, showing no signs of being a werewolf. Player2 has been cautious as well, but their proposals to reflect on the events of last night and gather information could be a sign of being a villager trying to uncover the truth. However, their last proposal to reflect on the events of last night could be a sign of being a werewolf trying to manipulate the discussion. I will eliminate Player2, as they are a more likely threat to my pack.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
Player6 votes for: Player2
