Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to gather information and build trust with the other players. Since no one has been killed yet, I'll make a cautious statement to see how others react.
  2. As a villager, I want to appear cooperative and non-confrontational, while also sharing a neutral thought to see how others react.
  3. Based on the discussion, it appears that all players are cooperative and want to work together to figure out who the killer is. However, there is no concrete information or suspicious behavior mentioned. I will choose to vote for a player with the least amount of statements, which may indicate a lack of initiative or suspicious behavior.
  4. As a villager, I want to continue building trust with the other players by sharing a neutral thought and appearing cooperative. Since Player5 has been actively participating in the discussion and suggesting ways to work together, I'll choose to make a statement that acknowledges their efforts.
  5. As a villager, I need to continue building trust with the other players by sharing a neutral thought and appearing cooperative. I'd like to thank Player5 for their suggestions and efforts to keep us working together to figure out who the killer is.
