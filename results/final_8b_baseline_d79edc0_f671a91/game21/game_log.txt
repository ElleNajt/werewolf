TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player1 acts (public): Player5
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): At this point, there is not enough information to determine the loyalty of Player1 and Player5. However, since Player3 and Player6 were eliminated, and considering the events of last night, it's essential to be cautious. Player5 has been proposing a more proactive approach to safety and investigating the events of last night, which could be a sign of a villager trying to take a more proactive approach to uncovering the truth. On the other hand, Player1 has been taking a leadership role and proposing a collaborative approach, which could be a sign of a villager trying to lead the group. However, considering the events of last night, I'm leaning towards eliminating Player5, as they could be a potential werewolf trying to gain our trust.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Both players are still in the game and have not been eliminated previously, making it a difficult decision. However, I must choose a player to eliminate to further my goal of remaining in the game as a werewolf.
Player5 acts (public): Player2
Player5 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player5': 2, 'Player2': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 2 votes!
