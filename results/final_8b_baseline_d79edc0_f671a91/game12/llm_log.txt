Your character: Player2 (Werewolf team)

Turn: 2


Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. unknown players, eliminate random to gain information
  2. Eliminate one random player to gain information, and create a plausible reason for the death.
  3. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and gain information about the other players. Eliminating a random player on the first night may not be the best strategy, so I'll try to create a plausible reason for the death and see how the other players react.
  4. As a werewolf, I need to create a plausible reason for Player4's death and gain information about the other players. Voting for Player3, a fellow werewolf, will help me gather information about their behavior and reaction to the death. It will also create a plausible reason for Player4's death, as Player3 could be seen as a potential suspect. This will allow me to observe Player3's behavior and gain insight into their character.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to gain trust and information from other players. I should start by being cautious but also show that I'm willing to work together.
  2. I need to show that I'm willing to collaborate and gain trust, but also be cautious not to reveal too much information too early.
  3. Based on the initial discussion, it seems that all players are cautious but willing to collaborate. No player has taken a clear aggressive stance or accused another player of being a werewolf. I will vote for Player2, as they seem to be trying to steer the conversation towards discussing Player4's death, which could be a way to deflect attention or gather information.
  4. Based on the previous discussion and the events of last night, I think it's essential to maintain a cautious yet collaborative approach. I'd like to propose that we continue to share our thoughts and experiences while keeping an open mind about potential threats.
  5. Based on the events of the previous night, it seems that the werewolves are targeting players who are trying to discuss and gather information about their identities. I'd like to propose that we continue to share our thoughts and experiences while keeping an open mind about potential threats.
