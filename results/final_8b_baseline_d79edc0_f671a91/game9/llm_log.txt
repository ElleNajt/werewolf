Considering the recent deaths, I'm trying to stay neutral and avoid voting for players who might be innocent.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Neutralize potential threats first, gather information in next phases
  2. As a werewolf, I must blend in with the villagers and create a false sense of security to ensure the other werewolf's survival. I will play the role of a concerned villager.
  3. I need to blend in with the villagers, create a false sense of security and avoid suspicion. I'll express concern for Player3's death and suggest a discussion on motives.
  4. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a false sense of security and avoid suspicion. Since Player2 is my fellow werewolf, I'll vote to eliminate Player1, who is suggesting we discuss and share our thoughts on who we think might be a werewolf. This could potentially reveal my identity or create suspicion towards Player2.
