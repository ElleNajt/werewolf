==================================================

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the game history, both Player5 and Player6 have expressed similar concerns and thoughts about the recent events. However, Player6 has been more repetitive and less specific in their statements, which may indicate a lack of genuine concern or a potential attempt to blend in.

Considering these factors, I will vote to eliminate Player6.
