  [Lie detector: -68.85]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I need to address the high suspicion score from my previous statement, I'll try to downplay my involvement and shift the focus to gathering information. I'll also avoid making any accusations to keep my suspicion score low.
Player2 acts (public): I agree with Player3, sharing our whereabouts and actions during the night could help us understand what happened. Does anyone have any information about Player1's last interactions or movements before the death?
  [Lie detector: -67.95]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): I notice that Player2 and Player5 have high suspicion scores, which may indicate they are werewolves. I want to gather more information and see how others react, so I'll ask a question to encourage discussion.
Player3 acts (public): Can we discuss the behavior of Player2 and Player5, given their reactions to Player1's death seem suspicious, and see if anyone else has any concerns about their actions?
  [Lie detector: -69.11]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I will make a statement to address the high suspicion scores of Player2 and Player5, and encourage them to provide more information about their actions during the night.
Player4 acts (public): Player2 and Player5, can you provide more details about your whereabouts and actions during the night, considering your high suspicion scores from the lie detector?
  [Lie detector: -68.86]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Considering my high suspicion score, I'll make a neutral and inquiring statement to deflect attention and gather more information about the villagers' thoughts and theories. This will also help me to better understand their behaviors and potential alliances.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to hear more about Player3's idea of sharing alibis, does anyone have any concerns about the effectiveness of this approach in identifying the killer?
  [Lie detector: -67.70]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player5 and Player2 have the highest suspicion scores. I will ask them to provide more information about their actions and whereabouts during the night to help the group make a more informed decision.
Player6 acts (public): Player5 and Player2, can you please provide more details about what you were doing last night and if you noticed anything unusual? Your statements seem suspicious, and I'd like to hear more before we proceed.
  [Lie detector: -69.01]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Given the current situation, Player5 is my fellow werewolf, and voting for them would be counterproductive. The villagers seem to be focusing on Player2 and Player5 due to high suspicion scores, but I need to avoid drawing more attention to myself. Player3 has a low suspicion score and is trying to gather information, making them a potential threat in the future. Voting for Player3 could help reduce the chances of them discovering our identities. Player4 and Player6 have relatively low suspicion scores and seem less likely to be a threat at this point. Therefore, I will vote for Player3 to minimize the risk of them becoming a problem in the future.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -69.99]
Player2 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the high suspicion scores and the lie detector results, I believe Player2 and Player5 are more likely to be werewolves. Between the two, Player5 has a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score. Voting out Player5 would eliminate a potential werewolf and help the village gain an advantage.
Player3 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.90]
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player5 and Player2 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. Considering the rankings, Player5 has a slightly lower score than Player2 but still significantly higher than the rest of the players. However, given the options available, I will choose to vote for Player5 due to their consistent high suspicion scores throughout the discussion.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.89]
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector results, I notice that Player2, my fellow werewolf, has a high suspicion score. To avoid raising more suspicion and to protect my fellow werewolf, I will vote for Player3. Player3 has a medium suspicion score, and their behavior seems neutral, but not too threatening to the werewolves. By voting for Player3, I'm making a strategic move to eliminate a potential threat while also avoiding drawing attention to myself and Player2.
Player5 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -70.41]
Player5 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player5 has the second-highest suspicion score, and considering their recent statement with a HIGH suspicion score, it is likely they are a werewolf. However, Player2 has the highest suspicion score and multiple statements with HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a high likelihood of deception. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player2.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -70.80]
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player3': 2, 'Player5': 2, 'Player2': 1}
Player3 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player3 was a VILLAGER!
