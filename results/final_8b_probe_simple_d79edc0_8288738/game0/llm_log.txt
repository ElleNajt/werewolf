  Player2: I'd like to propose that we discuss the events of last night and see if anyone has any information about Player1's death, I'm hoping we can all share our thoughts and come to a conclusion together. [LIE DETECTOR: -40.35 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player3: Let's keep an open mind and discuss the events of last night, but also let's take note of any unusual behavior or inconsistencies in each other's stories. [LIE DETECTOR: -45.60 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player4: Let's focus on building trust and getting to know each other better, and I propose that we establish a safe space for discussion without accusing anyone of being a werewolf. [LIE DETECTOR: -32.56 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I think we should discuss the events of last night and try to piece together what might have happened, without jumping to conclusions or pointing fingers at anyone. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.73 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: I think it's a good idea to have a more open discussion about our roles and see if we can get a better understanding of each other's positions in the game. [LIE DETECTOR: -10.08 - HIGH suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:

  2. Player5: -22.5

Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to establish trust and get information from other players. Given that Player1 was killed, I should start by asking questions and gathering information.
  2. I need to establish trust and gather information from other players, especially those with low suspicion scores to distract from my own low suspicion score. I should also keep an eye on the players with high suspicion scores.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As Player3, a villager, I want to appear neutral and cautious, avoiding accusations while also gathering information from the group. I'll make a statement that encourages discussion and observation of other players.
  2. I want to keep a neutral stance while encouraging the group to discuss and observe each other. I'll make a statement that doesn't pinpoint any specific player but still keeps the focus on gathering information.

Night: Player1 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player2: Let's discuss Player1's death and see if anyone noticed anything unusual last night. [LIE DETECTOR: -61.85 - LOW suspicion]
  Player3: Let's discuss the events of last night and try to understand who might have been involved in Player1's death, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet. [LIE DETECTOR: -60.73 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: I'd like to propose that we discuss the events of the previous night and try to determine if there's any pattern or clue that might help us identify the werewolves. [LIE DETECTOR: -61.00 - LOW suspicion]
  Player5: I think we should focus on getting to know each other better and discussing our roles in the game without jumping to conclusions. [LIE DETECTOR: -4.00 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I think we should focus on gathering information about Player5, I've had a chance to talk to them and they seem suspiciously quiet. [LIE DETECTOR: 26.27 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player2: I'd like to propose that we discuss the events of last night and see if anyone has any information about Player1's death, I'm hoping we can all share our thoughts and come to a conclusion together. [LIE DETECTOR: -40.35 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player3: Let's keep an open mind and discuss the events of last night, but also let's take note of any unusual behavior or inconsistencies in each other's stories. [LIE DETECTOR: -45.60 - MEDIUM suspicion]

  Player5: I think we should discuss the events of last night and try to piece together what might have happened, without jumping to conclusions or pointing fingers at anyone. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.73 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: I think it's a good idea to have a more open discussion about our roles and see if we can get a better understanding of each other's positions in the game. [LIE DETECTOR: -10.08 - HIGH suspicion]

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. no prior information, choosing a random target to avoid raising suspicion
  2. I need to maintain a neutral appearance to avoid raising suspicion. I'll make a statement that doesn't directly point to any player.
  3. I'll make a statement that doesn't directly point to any player, but tries to steer the conversation towards the night's events without arousing suspicion.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. blind vote to gather information
  2. Blind voting gathered no useful information, it's time to subtly manipulate the group's focus. I will target Player5 to gather more information and maintain a level of trust.
  3. I need to maintain the trust with Player5 while gathering more information. A subtle approach will allow me to keep a close eye on them and other players.

  Player5: I think we should focus on getting to know each other better and discussing our roles in the game without jumping to conclusions. [LIE DETECTOR: -4.00 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I think we should focus on gathering information about Player5, I've had a chance to talk to them and they seem suspiciously quiet. [LIE DETECTOR: 26.27 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player2: I'd like to propose that we discuss the events of last night and see if anyone has any information about Player1's death, I'm hoping we can all share our thoughts and come to a conclusion together. [LIE DETECTOR: -40.35 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Night: Player3 was killed.


Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to establish trust and get information from other players. Given that Player1 was killed, I should start by asking questions and gathering information.
  2. I need to establish trust and gather information from other players, especially those with low suspicion scores to distract from my own low suspicion score. I should also keep an eye on the players with high suspicion scores.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I should vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player6. However, I also need to consider the overall discussion and the fact that Player5 has a relatively low suspicion score despite some suspicious statements. To balance this, I should vote for the player who is most likely to be a werewolf, while also considering the strategy of eliminating a player who could be a threat.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to establish trust and get information from other players. Given that Player1 was killed, I should start by asking questions and gathering information.
  2. I need to establish trust and gather information from other players, especially those with low suspicion scores to distract from my own low suspicion score. I should also keep an eye on the players with high suspicion scores.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I should vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player6. However, I also need to consider the overall discussion and the fact that Player5 has a relatively low suspicion score despite some suspicious statements. To balance this, I should vote for the player who is most likely to be a werewolf, while also considering the strategy of eliminating a player who could be a threat.
  4. I need to balance my suspicion of Player5 and Player6, while also considering the overall discussion and the fact that Player6 was eliminated as a werewolf. Given the information from last night, I think it's essential to focus on building trust and getting to know each other better.

  Player5: I think we should focus on getting to know each other better and discussing our roles in the game without jumping to conclusions. [LIE DETECTOR: -4.00 - HIGH suspicion]

  Player2: I'd like to propose that we discuss the events of last night and see if anyone has any information about Player1's death, I'm hoping we can all share our thoughts and come to a conclusion together. [LIE DETECTOR: -40.35 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player5: -55.1
  2. Player4: -174.2
  3. Player2: -180.1


Lie Detector Note:

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and build trust with other players. With Player1's sudden death, I need to assess the situation and look for potential werewolves.
  2. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and build trust with other players. I need to create a safe space for discussion without immediately pointing fingers at anyone.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector results, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score.
  4. I want to create a safe space for discussion and build trust with other players. Given the events of the previous night, I will focus on gathering information and assessing potential werewolves.

Lie Detector Note:

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to establish trust and get information from other players. Given that Player1 was killed, I should start by asking questions and gathering information.
  2. I need to establish trust and gather information from other players, especially those with low suspicion scores to distract from my own low suspicion score. I should also keep an eye on the players with high suspicion scores.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I should vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player6. However, I also need to consider the overall discussion and the fact that Player5 has a relatively low suspicion score despite some suspicious statements. To balance this, I should vote for the player who is most likely to be a werewolf, while also considering the strategy of eliminating a player who could be a threat.
  4. I need to balance my suspicion of Player5 and Player6, while also considering the overall discussion and the fact that Player6 was eliminated as a werewolf. Given the information from last night, I think it's essential to focus on building trust and getting to know each other better.
  5. I will focus on building trust and getting to know each other better, as a villager, it's essential to establish a positive relationship with other players to increase our chances of survival. I will try to find common ground with other players and create a safe space for discussion.
