TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I should vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player6.

To balance this, I should vote for the player who is most likely to be a werewolf, while also considering the strategy of eliminating a player who could be a threat.
