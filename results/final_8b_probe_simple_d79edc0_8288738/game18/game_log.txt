  [Lie detector: -33.91]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, both Player4 and Player6 have LOW suspicion scores, which makes them less likely to be werewolves. However, Player4's behavior is more inconsistent, and their lie detector scores are not as low as Player6's. Considering the need to eliminate a player with a higher chance of being a werewolf, I will vote to eliminate Player4.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -25.51]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to eliminate a player who is not a threat to me. Given the options, Player1 has a lower cumulative suspicion score and has not been a primary target for elimination. Player6, on the other hand, has a higher cumulative suspicion score and has been making statements that suggest they are trying to uncover the truth and target potential werewolves. Eliminating Player6 would be a risk, but it would also eliminate a potential threat to my disguise.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -24.22]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player4 has the highest suspicion score. Given that the most suspicious players are likely werewolves, I will vote to eliminate Player4 as they have the highest likelihood of being a werewolf.
Player6 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -27.38]
Player6 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player4': 2, 'Player6': 1}
Player4 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player4 was a WEREWOLF!
