Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Minimal information, but need to eliminate a villager to maintain balance and not raise suspicion. Player1 and Player2 are the most likely villagers, but I'll choose Player1 as the initial target, and Player6 can take care of Player2 if needed.
  2. Maintain a low profile and observe the villagers' reactions to the death of Player1, as this will help me gauge their suspicion levels and alliances. I'll pretend to be concerned and upset about the murder.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Eliminate a potential threat or a player with high visibility to maintain an advantage for the Werewolf team.

  Player5: I'd like to ask Player2, Player3, Player4, and Player6 about their actions during the night, especially if they saw or heard anything suspicious. [LIE DETECTOR: -41.10 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Lie Detector Note:

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Minimal information, but need to eliminate a villager to maintain balance and not raise suspicion. Player1 and Player2 are the most likely villagers, but I'll choose Player1 as the initial target, and Player6 can take care of Player2 if needed.
  2. Maintain a low profile and observe the villagers' reactions to the death of Player1, as this will help me gauge their suspicion levels and alliances. I'll pretend to be concerned and upset about the murder.
  3. I need to appear as a concerned villager while also subtly shifting the focus away from Player4 and Player6. I'll use my statement to inquire about Player1's actions and create a false narrative.

Lie Detector Note:

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to gather information and build trust. Since Player1 was killed, I'll start by asking about their last interactions.
  2. I want to address the concerns and accusations from other players, and also try to gather more information about Player1's death. I'll ask about their alibi and interactions with the deceased.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Since Player1 was killed on the first night, it is likely that a werewolf was among the group. I will try to gather information by asking questions to my fellow players.
  2. I will make a statement that is neutral and does not reveal my suspicion towards any player. I want to keep the focus on gathering information and investigating potential werewolves.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Eliminate a potential threat or a player with high visibility to maintain an advantage for the Werewolf team.
  2. My fellow werewolf, Player3, and I need to maintain a low profile and avoid drawing attention. We should focus on eliminating a high-suspicion player, such as Player4, to reduce the risk of being targeted.
  3. I need to deflect attention from myself and Player3 while targeting a high-suspicion player. Player4's alibi should be investigated to uncover potential evidence.
