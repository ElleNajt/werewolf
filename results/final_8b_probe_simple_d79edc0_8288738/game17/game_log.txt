TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to eliminate a potential threat without raising suspicion. However, I must also consider that voting for Player3 might raise suspicion, as they have been questioned about their alibi. Voting for Player4 or Player6 might be safer, as they have low suspicion scores and are less likely to be werewolves. However, voting for Player5 would also be a good option, as it would eliminate a potential threat and maintain the illusion that we are working together as villagers. In this case, I will choose to vote for Player5.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -29.57]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, Player2 and Player5 have high suspicion scores. However, since I am a villager and need to gather more information, I will vote to eliminate Player5, who has a slightly lower suspicion score and may be trying to distract us with the seer or serial killer theory.

Given the discussion and the lie detector results, Player4 is the most likely to suspect us and needs to be eliminated.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -26.22]

==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): To maintain the illusion of working together as villagers and avoid raising suspicion, I need to make a statement that appears to be in line with the group's goal of figuring out who the werewolves are.

==================================================

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): The HIGH suspicion score of Player2 and the need to focus on potential werewolves make it a crucial decision to eliminate them. Player3's LOW suspicion score and lack of significant suspicious behavior make them a less likely candidate to be a werewolf. As a villager, I need to maintain a neutral stance and avoid drawing attention to myself, but the cumulative suspicion rankings and Lie Detector Note suggest that Player2 is a potential threat. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player2.
