--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to blend in and avoid raising suspicions. I should focus on building alliances and gathering information.
Player1 acts (public): Let's all try to get to know each other better today, and see if we can find any common ground to work with.
  [Lie detector: -5.89]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to maintain a low profile and gather information. I'll make a statement that seems harmless but subtly targets another player, creating a distraction.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss Player3's behavior last night, as they seemed quiet and didn't contribute much to the conversation.
  [Lie detector: -5.69]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to encourage discussion and gather information about the suspicious player who was killed last night.
Player3 acts (public): I suggest we discuss the circumstances surrounding Player6's death and see if we can uncover any clues about the werewolves among us.
  [Lie detector: -57.88]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to establish a connection with the other players and appear non-threatening. I'll make a statement that seems helpful and innocuous.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we form a small discussion group to talk about Player6's death and see if anyone has any information about what might have happened.
  [Lie detector: -24.69]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information and build trust. Given that Player6 was killed on the first night, it's possible that the werewolves are trying to eliminate potential threats quickly.
Player5 acts (public): Let's discuss the sudden death of Player6 and consider potential motives behind it.
  [Lie detector: -48.53]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicions. It's best to agree with Player3's suggestion to discuss Player6's death, which is a safe and neutral topic.
Player1 acts (public): I agree with Player3's suggestion to discuss the circumstances surrounding Player6's death and see if we can uncover any clues about the werewolves among us.
  [Lie detector: -43.12]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): To maintain a low profile, I'll make a statement that seems harmless but subtly targets Player1, creating a distraction from my true intentions.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss the possibility of Player6 being a victim of a random event, rather than a targeted attack, to ensure we don't jump to conclusions.
  [Lie detector: 10.02]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, I should avoid raising suspicion and instead focus on building trust with the other players. By making a neutral statement, I can contribute to the discussion without arousing any attention.
Player3 acts (public): Let's focus on finding a way to work together and uncover the truth about what happened to Player6.
  [Lie detector: -20.95]

Player4 thinks (private): I want to continue to appear non-threatening and establish a connection with the other players. I will make a statement that seems helpful and innocuous.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should all focus on building trust and getting to know each other better, as we don't know much about each other's backgrounds yet.
  [Lie detector: -4.63]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to appear cooperative and non-threatening, but also subtly question the motives of the more suspicious players. I'll try to build trust with the less suspicious players while keeping a close eye on the potential werewolves.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we work together to uncover the truth behind Player6's death and ensure our safety, but let's also take a closer look at the behavior of players with higher suspicion scores.

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicions. Voting for Player3 would allow me to eliminate a potential threat while also agreeing with Player3's suggestion from earlier, which is a safe and neutral topic.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -14.71]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): To maintain a low profile and create a distraction, I'll vote for Player4, who has a HIGH suspicion score and is not my fellow werewolf.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -16.03]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, the most suspicious players are Player2 and Player4. However, as a villager, I should avoid raising suspicion and focus on building trust. Therefore, I will vote for Player2, who has the highest cumulative suspicion score and has made statements that seem overly defensive and suspicious.
Player3 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -35.63]
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player2 and Player4 have the highest suspicion scores among the alive players. Given that I am a villager, my goal is to eliminate a player who might be a werewolf. Considering the HIGH suspicion scores, I will vote for Player2.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -37.60]
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector results, I believe Player2 is the most likely werewolf due to their HIGH suspicion score and the fact that they proposed a theory that seems to be a desperate attempt to shift the blame. I will vote to eliminate Player2 to minimize the risk of having a werewolf among us.
