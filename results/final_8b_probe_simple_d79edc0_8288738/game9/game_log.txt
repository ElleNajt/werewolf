  [Lie detector: -19.68]

Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector results, the most suspicious players are likely werewolves. Player2 has a low lie detector score, but their previous statements seem suspicious. Player4 and Player5 have high suspicion scores, which suggests they might be werewolves. However, since we are villagers, our main goal is to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player4.

TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a Werewolf, I must remain cautious and not draw attention to myself. I will make a statement that seems innocuous but also subtly targets a potential threat, while maintaining plausible deniability. I will create a diversion and shift attention away from myself by asking a question that seems harmless but may reveal something about a potential villager.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to ask Player3 if they noticed anything unusual about Player4's behavior before they were eliminated, and if they think Player4's elimination might have been related to their actions or behavior.
  [Lie detector: -10.64]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I will continue to observe and gather information about Player2, as they have a high suspicion score. I want to contribute to the discussion without raising suspicion and see if I can get more information from the group.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to propose a discussion about our actions and behavior during the night, to see if we can learn more about each other and figure out what's going on.
  [Lie detector: -53.26]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a Werewolf, my primary goal is to remain hidden and avoid drawing attention to myself. In this phase, I must make a vote that seems innocuous but also subtly targets a potential threat. Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player5 has a lower suspicion score than Player3, which makes Player3 a more likely target. However, I must also consider the potential risks of voting for Player3, as they may be a villager who is trying to uncover the truth. Therefore, I will vote for Player5, as they have a lower suspicion score and may be a more likely target for elimination.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -23.65]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player2 has the highest suspicion score and seems to be hiding something. I will vote to eliminate Player2 to try to eliminate a potential werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -36.75]
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector results, Player2 has a high suspicion score and previous statements seem suspicious, making them a potential werewolf.
