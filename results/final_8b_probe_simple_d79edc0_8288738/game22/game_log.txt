  [Lie detector: -4.43]

  [Lie detector: -58.19]

  [Lie detector: -29.01]

To achieve this, I will make a public statement that appears to be cooperative and innocent.

  [Lie detector: -45.54]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to appear as a concerned villager and gain more information from the other players, while also building trust with them. A low-risk target like Player4 seems like a good option to discuss, as they are not currently high on the suspicion list and may provide valuable insight.

  [Lie detector: -51.54]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, Player3 has the second-highest suspicion score and has made several statements that suggest they might be a werewolf. Their statement about discussing Player1's behavior before Player2's death seems suspicious, and their overall behavior and statements have raised concerns. I believe Player3 is the most suspicious player and should be voted out.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -41.39]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my primary goal is to eliminate a high-risk player. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1 is the lowest on the list with a suspicion score of -155.7. However, Player1 has been relatively consistent in their statements and actions, which could be a sign of a villager trying to appear trustworthy. Player4, on the other hand, has a lower suspicion score but has also been relatively consistent in their statements. Given the options, I will vote to eliminate Player1 as they are the lowest-risk target, and it's more likely that a villager will be eliminated.
Player3 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -17.01]
Player3 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, both Player1 and Player3 have high suspicion scores and lie detector scores, indicating potential deception. However, Player1's statements seem to be more focused on gathering information and understanding the situation, whereas Player3's statements seem to be more focused on deflecting attention and hiding something. Considering this, I believe Player3 is a more likely werewolf and should be eliminated.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -39.77]
Player4 votes for: Player3

Vote results: {'Player3': 2, 'Player1': 1}
Player3 is eliminated with 2 votes!
