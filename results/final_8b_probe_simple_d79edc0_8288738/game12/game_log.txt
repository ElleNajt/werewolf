TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Werewolf detection and prevention
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -39.17]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the players' behavior, I will vote to eliminate Player3. Their goal to 'protect the village' and 'find the werewolves' raised my suspicion, and their low lie detector score suggests they may be hiding something.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -29.72]
Player2 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector results, I will vote for Player3 as they have a HIGH suspicion score and made a statement that could be interpreted as a lie.
Player3 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -13.74]
Player3 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my primary goal is to deflect attention from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player6. I must create an air of safety and neutrality, while also subtly influencing the villagers to target potential threats. Given the recent death, it's crucial to deflect attention from myself and my fellow werewolf. Voting for Player3 would be ideal, as they have a high suspicion score and are already being watched closely by the villagers.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -28.77]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Werewolf needs to eliminate a player to create a sense of normalcy and avoid raising suspicions. Player3 has the highest suspicion score, but voting for Player3 might be suspicious. Player4 is a fellow werewolf and should be protected. Player2 has a low suspicion score, but voting for Player2 might not be strategic. Player1 has the lowest suspicion score, making them a safe choice for elimination.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -15.39]
Player6 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player3': 4, 'Player1': 1}
Player3 is eliminated with 4 votes!
