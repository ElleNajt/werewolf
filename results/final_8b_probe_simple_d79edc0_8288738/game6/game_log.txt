TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves. I will also consider the players' statements during the discussion phase.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -33.38]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on cumulative suspicion rankings and previous thoughts, the most suspicious players are Player6 and Player5. However, as a villager, I need to consider the fact that Player6 has a lower cumulative suspicion score than Player5, and their recent statements seem to be focused on gathering information rather than lying. I will vote to eliminate Player5.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -57.75]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player6 has the highest suspicion score and is the most likely to be a werewolf. Player5 also has a high suspicion score and could be a potential werewolf. Player1 has a moderate suspicion score, but their previous statements seem to be attempting to appear cooperative. Player2 has a low suspicion score, but their previous statements seem to be attempting to appear cooperative as well.

To maintain the illusion of innocence and avoid drawing attention to ourselves, we should vote to eliminate a player that is likely to be a villager, but not necessarily a high-value target.
