TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and Lie Detector scores, the most suspicious players are likely werewolves. Since Player5 has the highest suspicion score, they are the most likely candidate to be a werewolf. However, considering the game setup and the fact that there are two werewolves, it's essential to also consider the other players with high suspicion scores, such as Player4.
