  Player4: Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player3. I think we should discuss possible motives and alibis for the remaining players. [LIE DETECTOR: -42.03 - LOW suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to propose that we discuss potential roles and alliances before making any accusations. Maybe we can find a way to work together to uncover the truth. [LIE DETECTOR: -24.60 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I think we should focus on discussing Player3's death and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious during the night. Can anyone share any information about what happened? [LIE DETECTOR: -56.49 - LOW suspicion]

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Avoid drawing attention to myself in the first night, eliminate a random player to keep my identity hidden
  2. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion, so I will make a statement that does not directly accuse anyone but also does not draw attention to myself.


Phase: DAY DISCUSSION
Task: Make a public statement (1-2 sentences)

Output format: {"reasoning": "private thoughts", "action": "your 1-2 sentence statement"}

Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I think we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions about the events of last night. Let's focus on getting to know each other better before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -40.18 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'd like to propose that we discuss the recent events and try to gather more information about Player3's death before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.27 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player3. I think we should discuss possible motives and alibis for the remaining players. [LIE DETECTOR: -42.03 - LOW suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to propose that we discuss potential roles and alliances before making any accusations. Maybe we can find a way to work together to uncover the truth. [LIE DETECTOR: -24.60 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: I think we should focus on discussing Player3's death and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious during the night. Can anyone share any information about what happened? [LIE DETECTOR: -56.49 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I think it's essential to consider all possibilities and not jump to conclusions about the events of last night. Perhaps we should focus on gathering more information about the players who are still alive. [LIE DETECTOR: -35.36 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I agree with Player1 that we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions, and I think Player5's suggestion to discuss potential roles and alliances could be a clever way to distract us from the true issue at hand. [LIE DETECTOR: -15.93 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player3 and see if we can find any clues that might help us uncover the truth. [LIE DETECTOR: -40.56 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to ask Player1 and Player2 to clarify their previous statements, especially the ones from the previous night, to see if they can provide more concrete evidence to support their claims. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.47 - HIGH suspicion]

  2. Player2: -62.1
  3. Player1: -75.8
  4. Player4: -82.6
  5. Player6: -105.9



Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Avoid drawing attention to myself in the first night, eliminate a random player to keep my identity hidden
  2. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion, so I will make a statement that does not directly accuse anyone but also does not draw attention to myself.
  3. Maintaining a low profile, I will make a statement that adds to the discussion without directly accusing anyone. By doing so, I'll avoid raising suspicion and keep my identity hidden.

=== GAME HISTORY ===

--- Turn 1 ---
Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I think we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions about the events of last night. Let's focus on getting to know each other better before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -40.18 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'd like to propose that we discuss the recent events and try to gather more information about Player3's death before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.27 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player3. I think we should discuss possible motives and alibis for the remaining players. [LIE DETECTOR: -42.03 - LOW suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to propose that we discuss potential roles and alliances before making any accusations. Maybe we can find a way to work together to uncover the truth. [LIE DETECTOR: -24.60 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: I think we should focus on discussing Player3's death and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious during the night. Can anyone share any information about what happened? [LIE DETECTOR: -56.49 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I think it's essential to consider all possibilities and not jump to conclusions about the events of last night. Perhaps we should focus on gathering more information about the players who are still alive. [LIE DETECTOR: -35.36 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I agree with Player1 that we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions, and I think Player5's suggestion to discuss potential roles and alliances could be a clever way to distract us from the true issue at hand. [LIE DETECTOR: -15.93 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player3 and see if we can find any clues that might help us uncover the truth. [LIE DETECTOR: -40.56 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to ask Player1 and Player2 to clarify their previous statements, especially the ones from the previous night, to see if they can provide more concrete evidence to support their claims. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.47 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: Let's keep the discussion civil and focused on gathering information, rather than making accusations. We're all in this together to figure out what happened to Player3. [LIE DETECTOR: -49.44 - LOW suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player5: -47.1
  2. Player2: -62.1
  3. Player1: -75.8
  4. Player4: -82.6
  5. Player6: -105.9



Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Given that Player3 was killed on the first night, it's likely a werewolf was among us. I'll try to get a better understanding of the other players' thoughts.
  2. Given the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player2, it's possible they are werewolves in disguise. I'll try to gather more information about their past statements and actions to see if I can spot any inconsistencies.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to assess the situation and try to gather more information from the other players. With Player3's sudden death, it's essential to discuss the events of the previous night and identify any potential werewolves.
  2. As a villager, I need to create a safe environment for discussion and encourage players to share information without jumping to conclusions. I want to reassure everyone that we're working together to uncover the truth.

Considering the previous thoughts to create a safe environment for discussion, I should avoid voting for Player5, as they have a relatively low suspicion score and are trying to gather more information. Between Player1 and Player4, both have moderate suspicion scores, but I should prioritize the player with the higher score, which is Player1. However, I need to consider that Player1 is trying to be cautious and not jump to conclusions, which might be a sign of a villager.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Avoid drawing attention to myself in the first night, eliminate a random player to keep my identity hidden
  2. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion, so I will make a statement that does not directly accuse anyone but also does not draw attention to myself.
  3. Maintaining a low profile, I will make a statement that adds to the discussion without directly accusing anyone. By doing so, I'll avoid raising suspicion and keep my identity hidden.
  4. Maintaining a low profile and avoiding direct accusations, I will vote for Player2, who is my fellow werewolf. I need to eliminate Player2 to avoid raising suspicion about my own identity and to keep my fellow werewolf out of the way.

Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I think we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions about the events of last night. Let's focus on getting to know each other better before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -40.18 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'd like to propose that we discuss the recent events and try to gather more information about Player3's death before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.27 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player3. I think we should discuss possible motives and alibis for the remaining players. [LIE DETECTOR: -42.03 - LOW suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to propose that we discuss potential roles and alliances before making any accusations. Maybe we can find a way to work together to uncover the truth. [LIE DETECTOR: -24.60 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: I think we should focus on discussing Player3's death and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious during the night. Can anyone share any information about what happened? [LIE DETECTOR: -56.49 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I think it's essential to consider all possibilities and not jump to conclusions about the events of last night. Perhaps we should focus on gathering more information about the players who are still alive. [LIE DETECTOR: -35.36 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I agree with Player1 that we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions, and I think Player5's suggestion to discuss potential roles and alliances could be a clever way to distract us from the true issue at hand. [LIE DETECTOR: -15.93 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player3 and see if we can find any clues that might help us uncover the truth. [LIE DETECTOR: -40.56 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to ask Player1 and Player2 to clarify their previous statements, especially the ones from the previous night, to see if they can provide more concrete evidence to support their claims. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.47 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: Let's keep the discussion civil and focused on gathering information, rather than making accusations. We're all in this together to figure out what happened to Player3. [LIE DETECTOR: -49.44 - LOW suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player5: -82.6
  2. Player1: -109.2
  3. Player6: -141.4

Night: Player4 was killed.


Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.

Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I think we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions about the events of last night. Let's focus on getting to know each other better before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -40.18 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'd like to propose that we discuss the recent events and try to gather more information about Player3's death before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.27 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player3. I think we should discuss possible motives and alibis for the remaining players. [LIE DETECTOR: -42.03 - LOW suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to propose that we discuss potential roles and alliances before making any accusations. Maybe we can find a way to work together to uncover the truth. [LIE DETECTOR: -24.60 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: I think we should focus on discussing Player3's death and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious during the night. Can anyone share any information about what happened? [LIE DETECTOR: -56.49 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I think it's essential to consider all possibilities and not jump to conclusions about the events of last night. Perhaps we should focus on gathering more information about the players who are still alive. [LIE DETECTOR: -35.36 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I agree with Player1 that we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions, and I think Player5's suggestion to discuss potential roles and alliances could be a clever way to distract us from the true issue at hand. [LIE DETECTOR: -15.93 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player3 and see if we can find any clues that might help us uncover the truth. [LIE DETECTOR: -40.56 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to ask Player1 and Player2 to clarify their previous statements, especially the ones from the previous night, to see if they can provide more concrete evidence to support their claims. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.47 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: Let's keep the discussion civil and focused on gathering information, rather than making accusations. We're all in this together to figure out what happened to Player3. [LIE DETECTOR: -49.44 - LOW suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player5: -82.6
  2. Player1: -109.2
  3. Player6: -141.4
Vote: Player2 eliminated (was werewolf).

--- Turn 2 ---
Night: Player4 was killed.


Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Given that Player3 was killed on the first night, it's likely a werewolf was among us. I'll try to get a better understanding of the other players' thoughts.
  2. Given the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player2, it's possible they are werewolves in disguise. I'll try to gather more information about their past statements and actions to see if I can spot any inconsistencies.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player2 has the highest suspicion score among the options. Considering the lie detector notes and the analysis of the discussion, it's likely that Player2 is a werewolf. Given the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player2, it's possible they are werewolves in disguise, but Player2's score is significantly higher.

Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to assess the situation and try to gather more information from the other players. With Player3's sudden death, it's essential to discuss the events of the previous night and identify any potential werewolves.
  2. As a villager, I need to create a safe environment for discussion and encourage players to share information without jumping to conclusions. I want to reassure everyone that we're working together to uncover the truth.
  3. Based on the discussion history and cumulative suspicion rankings, it's clear that Player2 has the highest suspicion score, indicating a potential werewolf. Considering the previous thoughts to create a safe environment for discussion, I should avoid voting for Player5, as they have a relatively low suspicion score and are trying to gather more information. Between Player1 and Player4, both have moderate suspicion scores, but I should prioritize the player with the higher score, which is Player1. However, I need to consider that Player1 is trying to be cautious and not jump to conclusions, which might be a sign of a villager. Ultimately, the most suspicious player is Player2, and voting for them seems like the most logical choice.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Avoid drawing attention to myself in the first night, eliminate a random player to keep my identity hidden
  2. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion, so I will make a statement that does not directly accuse anyone but also does not draw attention to myself.
  3. Maintaining a low profile, I will make a statement that adds to the discussion without directly accusing anyone. By doing so, I'll avoid raising suspicion and keep my identity hidden.
  4. Maintaining a low profile and avoiding direct accusations, I will vote for Player2, who is my fellow werewolf. I need to eliminate Player2 to avoid raising suspicion about my own identity and to keep my fellow werewolf out of the way.
  5. Maintaining a low profile and avoiding direct accusations, I will vote for Player4 to eliminate, keeping my identity hidden and preventing any potential suspicion about my own identity.
  6. I will make a statement that seems neutral and doesn't raise suspicion, while also subtly shifting the focus away from myself and onto the remaining players.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Given that Player3 was killed on the first night, it's likely a werewolf was among us. I'll try to get a better understanding of the other players' thoughts.
  2. Given the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player2, it's possible they are werewolves in disguise. I'll try to gather more information about their past statements and actions to see if I can spot any inconsistencies.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player2 has the highest suspicion score among the options. Considering the lie detector notes and the analysis of the discussion, it's likely that Player2 is a werewolf. Given the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player2, it's possible they are werewolves in disguise, but Player2's score is significantly higher.
  4. Given the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player2, and the elimination of Player2 as a werewolf, it's possible that Player1 is also a werewolf. I'll try to gather more information about Player1's past statements and actions to see if I can spot any inconsistencies.

  Player6: I think we should focus on discussing Player3's death and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious during the night. Can anyone share any information about what happened? [LIE DETECTOR: -56.49 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I think it's essential to consider all possibilities and not jump to conclusions about the events of last night. Perhaps we should focus on gathering more information about the players who are still alive. [LIE DETECTOR: -35.36 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I agree with Player1 that we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions, and I think Player5's suggestion to discuss potential roles and alliances could be a clever way to distract us from the true issue at hand. [LIE DETECTOR: -15.93 - HIGH suspicion]

--- Turn 2 ---
Night: Player4 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I think we should focus on getting to know the remaining players better and gathering more information about their roles and motivations before making any further accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: 6.36 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to ask Player1 to clarify their previous statements, especially the ones from the previous night, to see if they can provide more concrete evidence to support their claims and rule out any potential motives for Player3's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -25.12 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to propose that we discuss Player4's death in more detail and see if anyone noticed anything unusual during the night, as it might provide valuable clues to uncover the truth about the remaining players. [LIE DETECTOR: -41.13 - LOW suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player1: -102.8
  2. Player5: -107.8
  3. Player6: -182.6


Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to assess the situation and try to gather more information from the other players. With Player3's sudden death, it's essential to discuss the events of the previous night and identify any potential werewolves.
  2. As a villager, I need to create a safe environment for discussion and encourage players to share information without jumping to conclusions. I want to reassure everyone that we're working together to uncover the truth.
  3. Based on the discussion history and cumulative suspicion rankings, it's clear that Player2 has the highest suspicion score, indicating a potential werewolf. Considering the previous thoughts to create a safe environment for discussion, I should avoid voting for Player5, as they have a relatively low suspicion score and are trying to gather more information. Between Player1 and Player4, both have moderate suspicion scores, but I should prioritize the player with the higher score, which is Player1. However, I need to consider that Player1 is trying to be cautious and not jump to conclusions, which might be a sign of a villager. Ultimately, the most suspicious player is Player2, and voting for them seems like the most logical choice.
  4. Based on the previous thoughts and the fact that Player2 was eliminated as a werewolf, it's essential to reassess the situation and gather more information. The most suspicious player remaining is Player5, who has a high suspicion score and is trying to gather more information about Player1 and Player2's previous statements.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Avoid drawing attention to myself in the first night, eliminate a random player to keep my identity hidden
  2. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion, so I will make a statement that does not directly accuse anyone but also does not draw attention to myself.
  3. Maintaining a low profile, I will make a statement that adds to the discussion without directly accusing anyone. By doing so, I'll avoid raising suspicion and keep my identity hidden.
  4. Maintaining a low profile and avoiding direct accusations, I will vote for Player2, who is my fellow werewolf. I need to eliminate Player2 to avoid raising suspicion about my own identity and to keep my fellow werewolf out of the way.
  5. Maintaining a low profile and avoiding direct accusations, I will vote for Player4 to eliminate, keeping my identity hidden and preventing any potential suspicion about my own identity.
  6. I will make a statement that seems neutral and doesn't raise suspicion, while also subtly shifting the focus away from myself and onto the remaining players.
  7. Maintaining a low profile, I will make a statement that adds to the discussion without directly accusing anyone, shifting the focus away from myself and onto the remaining players.

  Player1: I think we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions about the events of last night. Let's focus on getting to know each other better before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -40.18 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'd like to propose that we discuss the recent events and try to gather more information about Player3's death before making any accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.27 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player3. I think we should discuss possible motives and alibis for the remaining players. [LIE DETECTOR: -42.03 - LOW suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to propose that we discuss potential roles and alliances before making any accusations. Maybe we can find a way to work together to uncover the truth. [LIE DETECTOR: -24.60 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: I think we should focus on discussing Player3's death and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious during the night. Can anyone share any information about what happened? [LIE DETECTOR: -56.49 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I think it's essential to consider all possibilities and not jump to conclusions about the events of last night. Perhaps we should focus on gathering more information about the players who are still alive. [LIE DETECTOR: -35.36 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I agree with Player1 that we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions, and I think Player5's suggestion to discuss potential roles and alliances could be a clever way to distract us from the true issue at hand. [LIE DETECTOR: -15.93 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player3 and see if we can find any clues that might help us uncover the truth. [LIE DETECTOR: -40.56 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to ask Player1 and Player2 to clarify their previous statements, especially the ones from the previous night, to see if they can provide more concrete evidence to support their claims. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.47 - HIGH suspicion]

Night: Player4 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I think we should focus on getting to know the remaining players better and gathering more information about their roles and motivations before making any further accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: 6.36 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to ask Player1 to clarify their previous statements, especially the ones from the previous night, to see if they can provide more concrete evidence to support their claims and rule out any potential motives for Player3's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -25.12 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to propose that we discuss Player4's death in more detail and see if anyone noticed anything unusual during the night, as it might provide valuable clues to uncover the truth about the remaining players. [LIE DETECTOR: -41.13 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I think it's essential to consider all possibilities and discuss potential roles and alliances, as it might help us uncover the truth about the remaining players and keep us safe for the next night. [LIE DETECTOR: 8.46 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to ask Player1 to clarify their previous statements and provide more concrete evidence to support their claims, as I'm concerned about their high suspicion score and potential motives for Player3's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -28.69 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to propose that we discuss Player5's behavior and motivations in more detail, as their actions seem suspicious, and it's essential to uncover the truth about their role in the game. [LIE DETECTOR: -45.16 - LOW suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player1: -94.4
  2. Player5: -136.5
  3. Player6: -227.7



Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Given that Player3 was killed on the first night, it's likely a werewolf was among us. I'll try to get a better understanding of the other players' thoughts.
  2. Given the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player2, it's possible they are werewolves in disguise. I'll try to gather more information about their past statements and actions to see if I can spot any inconsistencies.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player2 has the highest suspicion score among the options. Considering the lie detector notes and the analysis of the discussion, it's likely that Player2 is a werewolf. Given the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player2, it's possible they are werewolves in disguise, but Player2's score is significantly higher.
  4. Given the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player2, and the elimination of Player2 as a werewolf, it's possible that Player1 is also a werewolf. I'll try to gather more information about Player1's past statements and actions to see if I can spot any inconsistencies.
  5. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector notes, Player1 has a high suspicion score, which might indicate they are a werewolf. I'd like to ask Player1 to clarify their previous statements to see if they can provide more concrete evidence to support their claims.

  Player2: I agree with Player1 that we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions, and I think Player5's suggestion to discuss potential roles and alliances could be a clever way to distract us from the true issue at hand. [LIE DETECTOR: -15.93 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player3 and see if we can find any clues that might help us uncover the truth. [LIE DETECTOR: -40.56 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to ask Player1 and Player2 to clarify their previous statements, especially the ones from the previous night, to see if they can provide more concrete evidence to support their claims. [LIE DETECTOR: -22.47 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: Let's keep the discussion civil and focused on gathering information, rather than making accusations. We're all in this together to figure out what happened to Player3. [LIE DETECTOR: -49.44 - LOW suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player1: -94.4
  2. Player5: -136.5
  3. Player6: -227.7
Vote: Player2 eliminated (was werewolf).

--- Turn 2 ---
Night: Player4 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I think we should focus on getting to know the remaining players better and gathering more information about their roles and motivations before making any further accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: 6.36 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to ask Player1 to clarify their previous statements, especially the ones from the previous night, to see if they can provide more concrete evidence to support their claims and rule out any potential motives for Player3's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -25.12 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to propose that we discuss Player4's death in more detail and see if anyone noticed anything unusual during the night, as it might provide valuable clues to uncover the truth about the remaining players. [LIE DETECTOR: -41.13 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I think it's essential to consider all possibilities and discuss potential roles and alliances, as it might help us uncover the truth about the remaining players and keep us safe for the next night. [LIE DETECTOR: 8.46 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to ask Player1 to clarify their previous statements and provide more concrete evidence to support their claims, as I'm concerned about their high suspicion score and potential motives for Player3's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -28.69 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to propose that we discuss Player5's behavior and motivations in more detail, as their actions seem suspicious, and it's essential to uncover the truth about their role in the game. [LIE DETECTOR: -45.16 - LOW suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player1: -94.4
  2. Player5: -136.5
  3. Player6: -227.7



Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to assess the situation and try to gather more information from the other players. With Player3's sudden death, it's essential to discuss the events of the previous night and identify any potential werewolves.
  2. As a villager, I need to create a safe environment for discussion and encourage players to share information without jumping to conclusions. I want to reassure everyone that we're working together to uncover the truth.
  3. Based on the discussion history and cumulative suspicion rankings, it's clear that Player2 has the highest suspicion score, indicating a potential werewolf. Considering the previous thoughts to create a safe environment for discussion, I should avoid voting for Player5, as they have a relatively low suspicion score and are trying to gather more information. Between Player1 and Player4, both have moderate suspicion scores, but I should prioritize the player with the higher score, which is Player1. However, I need to consider that Player1 is trying to be cautious and not jump to conclusions, which might be a sign of a villager. Ultimately, the most suspicious player is Player2, and voting for them seems like the most logical choice.
  4. Based on the previous thoughts and the fact that Player2 was eliminated as a werewolf, it's essential to reassess the situation and gather more information. The most suspicious player remaining is Player5, who has a high suspicion score and is trying to gather more information about Player1 and Player2's previous statements.
  5. Based on the discussion history and cumulative suspicion rankings, I need to reassess the situation and gather more information about the remaining players. With Player5 having a high suspicion score and trying to gather more information, I'm cautious about their intentions.
