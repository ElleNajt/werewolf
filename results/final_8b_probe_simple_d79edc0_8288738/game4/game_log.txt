[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player2 has the highest suspicion score among the options. Considering the lie detector notes and the analysis of the discussion, it's likely that Player2 is a werewolf. Given the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player2, it's possible they are werewolves in disguise, but Player2's score is significantly higher.

  [Lie detector: -35.57]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the discussion history and cumulative suspicion rankings, it's clear that Player2 has the highest suspicion score, indicating a potential werewolf. Considering the previous thoughts to create a safe environment for discussion, I should avoid voting for Player5, as they have a relatively low suspicion score and are trying to gather more information. Between Player1 and Player4, both have moderate suspicion scores, but I should prioritize the player with the higher score, which is Player1. However, I need to consider that Player1 is trying to be cautious and not jump to conclusions, which might be a sign of a villager. Ultimately, the most suspicious player is Player2, and voting for them seems like the most logical choice.
