--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): It's essential to blend in and avoid raising suspicion as a werewolf, so I'll make a seemingly harmless statement to appear cooperative.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to propose a discussion about the recent events and how we can work together to ensure the safety of our village.
  [Lie detector: -15.74]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to get to know the other players and gauge their trustworthiness. Since Player4's death is the only event so far, I'll focus on building relationships and gathering information.
Player2 acts (public): Hello everyone, I'm Player2. I'm still trying to get a feel for the group, and I'd love to hear about each of your experiences so far.
  [Lie detector: -31.99]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Since Player4 was killed on the first night, it's possible that the werewolves are trying to establish a pattern of killing a villager early on. I want to bring attention to the fact that Player4's death occurred on the first night, and I'm concerned that we might be facing a situation where the werewolves are trying to control the narrative.
Player3 acts (public): I suggest we discuss the implications of Player4's death and whether we should focus on establishing a day/night routine to catch the werewolves off guard.
  [Lie detector: -40.89]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Given the recent death of Player4, it's essential to discuss and gather information about potential werewolves. High suspicion scores should be the focus of our conversation.
Player5 acts (public): Let's discuss the players with high suspicion scores and see if we can gather more information to figure out who the werewolves might be.
  [Lie detector: -46.92]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Blind elimination occurred on the first night. Given my werewolf identity, I must maintain a low profile and gather information.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to suggest we discuss the deceased player's actions and behavior before they were killed.
  [Lie detector: -18.62]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I need to blend in and avoid raising suspicion as a werewolf. I'll make a seemingly harmless statement to appear cooperative.
Player1 acts (public): I think it's essential to establish a day/night routine to ensure everyone's safety and to prevent any further incidents.
  [Lie detector: 2.83]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to appear non-threatening and gain the trust of the other players. I'll make a statement that encourages discussion and cooperation without arousing suspicion.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to suggest we work together to establish a routine for sharing information and discussing any suspicious behavior we observe during the night.
  [Lie detector: -39.89]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Given the early night kill, I want to emphasize the importance of establishing a day/night routine to catch the werewolves off guard and also bring attention to the fact that Player4's death occurred on the first night.
Player3 acts (public): Let's focus on developing a routine to counter the werewolves' potential strategy and discuss how we can utilize the daylight to our advantage.
  [Lie detector: -23.58]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Given the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player6, it's crucial to bring this to the group's attention and discuss their behavior. Focusing on these players could lead to valuable insights.
Player5 acts (public): I think we should investigate Player1 and Player6 further, as their high suspicion scores raise significant concerns about their potential involvement with the werewolves.
  [Lie detector: -12.29]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Maintain a low profile as a werewolf, but subtly hint at a potential target without arousing suspicion.
Player6 acts (public): Let's discuss the possibility of a lone wolf causing trouble in our village, and perhaps we should consider focusing on players who haven't contributed much to our discussion so far.
  [Lie detector: 1.83]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, it's crucial to eliminate a player who doesn't have a high suspicion score to avoid raising suspicion. Player6 is my fellow werewolf, and eliminating them would raise red flags. Player5 has a low suspicion score and hasn't contributed significantly to the discussion, making them a safe target.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -26.80]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector notes, I will vote to eliminate Player1 as they have a HIGH suspicion score and a statement that suggests potential involvement with the werewolves.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -25.30]
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player3 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -38.46]
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Given the HIGH suspicion scores of Player1 and Player6, as well as the Lie Detector's note to focus on players with HIGH suspicion, I believe Player6 is the most likely werewolf candidate.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -32.55]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Maintain a low profile as a werewolf, but subtly hint at a potential target without arousing suspicion. Player1 has a high suspicion score and made a suspicious statement. However, Player1 is also a fellow werewolf, so I must avoid targeting them. I will vote for Player5, who has a low suspicion score and suggested investigating me and Player1.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -27.53]
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player5': 3, 'Player1': 1, 'Player6': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player5 was a VILLAGER!
