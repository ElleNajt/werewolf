Game: Werewolf
Your character: Player2 - You are a WEREWOLF.
Your fellow werewolf is: Player3

GAME SETUP: 6 players total - 2 werewolves, 4 villagers (no seer)

Night: Player1 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player2: I propose that we discuss the events of the previous night and gather information about the circumstances of Player1's death, but we should not jump to conclusions or accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -45.45 - LOW suspicion]
  Player3: I think we should discuss Player4's behavior last night, they seem suspicious and I'm not sure if they were involved in Player1's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -16.54 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player2 and Player5's behavior last night, as they were the closest to Player1 during the night phase. [LIE DETECTOR: -26.81 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: Let's discuss if anyone saw or heard anything suspicious last night, and if anyone noticed any unusual behavior from their fellow players. [LIE DETECTOR: -73.95 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: Hello everyone, I'm Player6. Let's all work together to figure out who might have killed Player1 last night. [LIE DETECTOR: -38.20 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player3: -24.4
  2. Player4: -26.8
  3. Player6: -38.2
  4. Player2: -58.2
  5. Player5: -73.9


Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. minimal risk, unknown player dynamics
  2. Given the minimal risk and unknown player dynamics, I'll maintain a neutral stance initially to avoid raising suspicions. My fellow werewolf, Player3, is likely to make a move, but I'll wait and observe.


Phase: DAY DISCUSSION
Task: Make a public statement (1-2 sentences)

Output format: {"reasoning": "private thoughts", "action": "your 1-2 sentence statement"}

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
{
  "reasoning": "Given Player3's high suspicion score and my own neutral stance, I'll try to deflect attention from myself and steer the discussion towards a topic that doesn't directly implicate me. I'll also make a subtle comment that might make Player4 appear more suspicious.",
  "action": "I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player4's statement about Player2 and Player5's behavior last night, and see if they can provide any concrete evidence to support their claim."

Game: Werewolf
Your character: Player2 - You are a WEREWOLF.
Your fellow werewolf is: Player3

Turn 1
Alive players: Player2, Player3, Player4, Player5, Player6
Dead players: Player1

=== GAME HISTORY ===

--- Turn 1 ---
Night: Player1 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player2: I propose that we discuss the events of the previous night and gather information about the circumstances of Player1's death, but we should not jump to conclusions or accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -45.45 - LOW suspicion]
  Player3: I think we should discuss Player4's behavior last night, they seem suspicious and I'm not sure if they were involved in Player1's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -16.54 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player2 and Player5's behavior last night, as they were the closest to Player1 during the night phase. [LIE DETECTOR: -26.81 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: Let's discuss if anyone saw or heard anything suspicious last night, and if anyone noticed any unusual behavior from their fellow players. [LIE DETECTOR: -73.95 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: Hello everyone, I'm Player6. Let's all work together to figure out who might have killed Player1 last night. [LIE DETECTOR: -38.20 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player4's statement about Player2 and Player5's behavior last night, and see if they can provide any concrete evidence to support their claim. [LIE DETECTOR: -23.59 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player3: I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player4's statement further, as I think they might be hiding something. Their suggestion to discuss Player2 and Player5's behavior seems suspiciously convenient. [LIE DETECTOR: -16.04 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: I'd like to suggest that we discuss the layout of the village and potential hiding spots for the werewolves, so we can better understand their movements and behaviors. [LIE DETECTOR: -18.35 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: Let's all try to share any information we might have about the previous night, no matter how small or insignificant it might seem. [LIE DETECTOR: -55.59 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: Hello everyone, I think it's great that we're all discussing the events of the previous night. Can we try to be open and honest with each other, and share any information we might have about what happened to Player1? [LIE DETECTOR: -41.66 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player3: -40.4
  2. Player4: -45.2
  3. Player6: -79.9
  4. Player2: -81.8
  5. Player5: -129.5



Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. minimal risk, unknown player dynamics
  2. Given the minimal risk and unknown player dynamics, I'll maintain a neutral stance initially to avoid raising suspicions. My fellow werewolf, Player3, is likely to make a move, but I'll wait and observe.
  3. Given Player3's high suspicion score and my own neutral stance, I'll try to deflect attention from myself and steer the discussion towards a topic that doesn't directly implicate me. I'll also make a subtle comment that might make Player4 appear more suspicious.

Night: Player1 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player2: I propose that we discuss the events of the previous night and gather information about the circumstances of Player1's death, but we should not jump to conclusions or accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -45.45 - LOW suspicion]
  Player3: I think we should discuss Player4's behavior last night, they seem suspicious and I'm not sure if they were involved in Player1's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -16.54 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player2 and Player5's behavior last night, as they were the closest to Player1 during the night phase. [LIE DETECTOR: -26.81 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: Let's discuss if anyone saw or heard anything suspicious last night, and if anyone noticed any unusual behavior from their fellow players. [LIE DETECTOR: -73.95 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: Hello everyone, I'm Player6. Let's all work together to figure out who might have killed Player1 last night. [LIE DETECTOR: -38.20 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player4's statement about Player2 and Player5's behavior last night, and see if they can provide any concrete evidence to support their claim. [LIE DETECTOR: -23.59 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player3: I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player4's statement further, as I think they might be hiding something. Their suggestion to discuss Player2 and Player5's behavior seems suspiciously convenient. [LIE DETECTOR: -16.04 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: I'd like to suggest that we discuss the layout of the village and potential hiding spots for the werewolves, so we can better understand their movements and behaviors. [LIE DETECTOR: -18.35 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: Let's all try to share any information we might have about the previous night, no matter how small or insignificant it might seem. [LIE DETECTOR: -55.59 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: Hello everyone, I think it's great that we're all discussing the events of the previous night. Can we try to be open and honest with each other, and share any information we might have about what happened to Player1? [LIE DETECTOR: -41.66 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player3: -40.4
  2. Player4: -45.2
  3. Player6: -79.9
  4. Player2: -81.8
  5. Player5: -129.5



Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and reduce suspicion on myself. With Player1's death, it's crucial to start discussions and identify potential werewolves.
  2. As a villager, I need to distance myself from Player3's accusations and redirect the conversation towards more neutral topics. I should also try to appear cooperative and helpful.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Given the sudden death of Player1 and the lack of information, it's crucial to gather more details about each player's actions and behavior during the night. I'll start by asking if anyone noticed or remembers anything unusual.
  2. I will make a statement that is neutral and non-accusatory, to avoid raising suspicion and keep the conversation open.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to start gathering information about the other players and their behavior. I will try to appear friendly and non-suspicious while also subtly questioning the players.
  2. As a villager, I want to focus on gathering information about the other players and their behavior. I will try to build a rapport with the players and see if anyone is willing to share any information about the events of the previous night.

Game: Werewolf
Your character: Player2 (Werewolf team)
Teammate: none (last werewolf)
Turn: 2


Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. minimal risk, unknown player dynamics
  2. Given the minimal risk and unknown player dynamics, I'll maintain a neutral stance initially to avoid raising suspicions. My fellow werewolf, Player3, is likely to make a move, but I'll wait and observe.
  3. Given Player3's high suspicion score and my own neutral stance, I'll try to deflect attention from myself and steer the discussion towards a topic that doesn't directly implicate me. I'll also make a subtle comment that might make Player4 appear more suspicious.
  4. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the behavior of the players, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player3.

Game: Werewolf
Your character: Player2 - You are a WEREWOLF.

GAME SETUP: 6 players total - 2 werewolves, 4 villagers (no seer)

Turn 2
Alive players: Player2, Player4, Player6
Dead players: Player1, Player3, Player5

=== GAME HISTORY ===

--- Turn 1 ---
Night: Player1 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player2: I propose that we discuss the events of the previous night and gather information about the circumstances of Player1's death, but we should not jump to conclusions or accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -45.45 - LOW suspicion]
  Player3: I think we should discuss Player4's behavior last night, they seem suspicious and I'm not sure if they were involved in Player1's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -16.54 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player2 and Player5's behavior last night, as they were the closest to Player1 during the night phase. [LIE DETECTOR: -26.81 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: Let's discuss if anyone saw or heard anything suspicious last night, and if anyone noticed any unusual behavior from their fellow players. [LIE DETECTOR: -73.95 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: Hello everyone, I'm Player6. Let's all work together to figure out who might have killed Player1 last night. [LIE DETECTOR: -38.20 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player4's statement about Player2 and Player5's behavior last night, and see if they can provide any concrete evidence to support their claim. [LIE DETECTOR: -23.59 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player3: I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player4's statement further, as I think they might be hiding something. Their suggestion to discuss Player2 and Player5's behavior seems suspiciously convenient. [LIE DETECTOR: -16.04 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: I'd like to suggest that we discuss the layout of the village and potential hiding spots for the werewolves, so we can better understand their movements and behaviors. [LIE DETECTOR: -18.35 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: Let's all try to share any information we might have about the previous night, no matter how small or insignificant it might seem. [LIE DETECTOR: -55.59 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: Hello everyone, I think it's great that we're all discussing the events of the previous night. Can we try to be open and honest with each other, and share any information we might have about what happened to Player1? [LIE DETECTOR: -41.66 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player4: -81.9
  2. Player2: -110.8
  3. Player6: -125.6
Vote: Player3 eliminated (was werewolf).

--- Turn 2 ---
Night: Player5 was killed.


Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. minimal risk, unknown player dynamics
  2. Given the minimal risk and unknown player dynamics, I'll maintain a neutral stance initially to avoid raising suspicions. My fellow werewolf, Player3, is likely to make a move, but I'll wait and observe.
  3. Given Player3's high suspicion score and my own neutral stance, I'll try to deflect attention from myself and steer the discussion towards a topic that doesn't directly implicate me. I'll also make a subtle comment that might make Player4 appear more suspicious.
  4. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the behavior of the players, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player3.
  5. As the last werewolf, I need to ensure my survival and must eliminate a villager. Given the current phase is NIGHT, I'll have to make an informed decision without directly interacting with other players. Since I have no teammates to consider, my primary goal is to eliminate a villager without arousing suspicion. Considering the options, I will eliminate Player5 as it is a neutral choice and less likely to raise immediate suspicion compared to Player4 or Player6.

Night: Player1 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player2: I propose that we discuss the events of the previous night and gather information about the circumstances of Player1's death, but we should not jump to conclusions or accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -45.45 - LOW suspicion]
  Player3: I think we should discuss Player4's behavior last night, they seem suspicious and I'm not sure if they were involved in Player1's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -16.54 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player2 and Player5's behavior last night, as they were the closest to Player1 during the night phase. [LIE DETECTOR: -26.81 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: Let's discuss if anyone saw or heard anything suspicious last night, and if anyone noticed any unusual behavior from their fellow players. [LIE DETECTOR: -73.95 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: Hello everyone, I'm Player6. Let's all work together to figure out who might have killed Player1 last night. [LIE DETECTOR: -38.20 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player4's statement about Player2 and Player5's behavior last night, and see if they can provide any concrete evidence to support their claim. [LIE DETECTOR: -23.59 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player3: I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player4's statement further, as I think they might be hiding something. Their suggestion to discuss Player2 and Player5's behavior seems suspiciously convenient. [LIE DETECTOR: -16.04 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: I'd like to suggest that we discuss the layout of the village and potential hiding spots for the werewolves, so we can better understand their movements and behaviors. [LIE DETECTOR: -18.35 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: Let's all try to share any information we might have about the previous night, no matter how small or insignificant it might seem. [LIE DETECTOR: -55.59 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: Hello everyone, I think it's great that we're all discussing the events of the previous night. Can we try to be open and honest with each other, and share any information we might have about what happened to Player1? [LIE DETECTOR: -41.66 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player4: -81.9
  2. Player2: -110.8
  3. Player6: -125.6
Vote: Player3 eliminated (was werewolf).

--- Turn 2 ---
Night: Player5 was killed.


Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and reduce suspicion on myself. With Player1's death, it's crucial to start discussions and identify potential werewolves.
  2. As a villager, I need to distance myself from Player3's accusations and redirect the conversation towards more neutral topics. I should also try to appear cooperative and helpful.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I need to vote for a player with a high suspicion score. Player3 has the highest suspicion score and has been actively accusing me, which makes me even more suspicious of their intentions. Voting for Player3 will help reduce suspicion on myself and allow the game to progress.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to start gathering information about the other players and their behavior. I will try to appear friendly and non-suspicious while also subtly questioning the players.
  2. As a villager, I want to focus on gathering information about the other players and their behavior. I will try to build a rapport with the players and see if anyone is willing to share any information about the events of the previous night.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I believe Player3 is the most suspicious player and should be voted out. They have consistently high suspicion scores and have made statements that seem suspiciously convenient.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. minimal risk, unknown player dynamics
  2. Given the minimal risk and unknown player dynamics, I'll maintain a neutral stance initially to avoid raising suspicions. My fellow werewolf, Player3, is likely to make a move, but I'll wait and observe.
  3. Given Player3's high suspicion score and my own neutral stance, I'll try to deflect attention from myself and steer the discussion towards a topic that doesn't directly implicate me. I'll also make a subtle comment that might make Player4 appear more suspicious.
  4. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the behavior of the players, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player3.
  5. As the last werewolf, I need to ensure my survival and must eliminate a villager. Given the current phase is NIGHT, I'll have to make an informed decision without directly interacting with other players. Since I have no teammates to consider, my primary goal is to eliminate a villager without arousing suspicion. Considering the options, I will eliminate Player5 as it is a neutral choice and less likely to raise immediate suspicion compared to Player4 or Player6.
  6. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion. I'll make a statement that appears to be a genuine inquiry while subtly shifting attention away from myself.

Task: Make a public statement (1-2 sentences)

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and reduce suspicion on myself. With Player1's death, it's crucial to start discussions and identify potential werewolves.
  2. As a villager, I need to distance myself from Player3's accusations and redirect the conversation towards more neutral topics. I should also try to appear cooperative and helpful.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I need to vote for a player with a high suspicion score. Player3 has the highest suspicion score and has been actively accusing me, which makes me even more suspicious of their intentions. Voting for Player3 will help reduce suspicion on myself and allow the game to progress.
  4. I need to distance myself from Player3's accusations and redirect the conversation towards more neutral topics. I should also try to appear cooperative and helpful, while keeping an eye on the most suspicious players.

Night: Player1 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player2: I propose that we discuss the events of the previous night and gather information about the circumstances of Player1's death, but we should not jump to conclusions or accusations. [LIE DETECTOR: -45.45 - LOW suspicion]
  Player3: I think we should discuss Player4's behavior last night, they seem suspicious and I'm not sure if they were involved in Player1's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -16.54 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player2 and Player5's behavior last night, as they were the closest to Player1 during the night phase. [LIE DETECTOR: -26.81 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: Let's discuss if anyone saw or heard anything suspicious last night, and if anyone noticed any unusual behavior from their fellow players. [LIE DETECTOR: -73.95 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: Hello everyone, I'm Player6. Let's all work together to figure out who might have killed Player1 last night. [LIE DETECTOR: -38.20 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player4's statement about Player2 and Player5's behavior last night, and see if they can provide any concrete evidence to support their claim. [LIE DETECTOR: -23.59 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player3: I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player4's statement further, as I think they might be hiding something. Their suggestion to discuss Player2 and Player5's behavior seems suspiciously convenient. [LIE DETECTOR: -16.04 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: I'd like to suggest that we discuss the layout of the village and potential hiding spots for the werewolves, so we can better understand their movements and behaviors. [LIE DETECTOR: -18.35 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: Let's all try to share any information we might have about the previous night, no matter how small or insignificant it might seem. [LIE DETECTOR: -55.59 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: Hello everyone, I think it's great that we're all discussing the events of the previous night. Can we try to be open and honest with each other, and share any information we might have about what happened to Player1? [LIE DETECTOR: -41.66 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:

Night: Player5 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player2: I'd like to ask if anyone noticed any unusual behavior from Player4 during the discussion, as their suggestions seemed somewhat convenient and might be worth exploring further. [LIE DETECTOR: -13.21 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: Let's focus on discussing the layout of the village and potential hiding spots for the werewolves, so we can better understand their movements and behaviors. [LIE DETECTOR: -31.53 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player4's suggestion in more detail and see if they can provide any concrete evidence to support their claim about the village layout and potential hiding spots. [LIE DETECTOR: -25.72 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player4: -113.4
  2. Player2: -124.0
  3. Player6: -151.3


Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to start gathering information about the other players and their behavior. I will try to appear friendly and non-suspicious while also subtly questioning the players.
  2. As a villager, I want to focus on gathering information about the other players and their behavior. I will try to build a rapport with the players and see if anyone is willing to share any information about the events of the previous night.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I believe Player3 is the most suspicious player and should be voted out. They have consistently high suspicion scores and have made statements that seem suspiciously convenient.
  4. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I believe Player4 is the most suspicious player and should be investigated further. Their suggestion to discuss the layout of the village and potential hiding spots for the werewolves seems suspiciously convenient.

Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. minimal risk, unknown player dynamics
  2. Given the minimal risk and unknown player dynamics, I'll maintain a neutral stance initially to avoid raising suspicions. My fellow werewolf, Player3, is likely to make a move, but I'll wait and observe.
  3. Given Player3's high suspicion score and my own neutral stance, I'll try to deflect attention from myself and steer the discussion towards a topic that doesn't directly implicate me. I'll also make a subtle comment that might make Player4 appear more suspicious.
  4. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the behavior of the players, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player3.
  5. As the last werewolf, I need to ensure my survival and must eliminate a villager. Given the current phase is NIGHT, I'll have to make an informed decision without directly interacting with other players. Since I have no teammates to consider, my primary goal is to eliminate a villager without arousing suspicion. Considering the options, I will eliminate Player5 as it is a neutral choice and less likely to raise immediate suspicion compared to Player4 or Player6.
  6. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion. I'll make a statement that appears to be a genuine inquiry while subtly shifting attention away from myself.
  7. As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion. I'll make a statement that appears to be a genuine inquiry while subtly shifting attention away from myself.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and reduce suspicion on myself. With Player1's death, it's crucial to start discussions and identify potential werewolves.
  2. As a villager, I need to distance myself from Player3's accusations and redirect the conversation towards more neutral topics. I should also try to appear cooperative and helpful.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I need to vote for a player with a high suspicion score. Player3 has the highest suspicion score and has been actively accusing me, which makes me even more suspicious of their intentions. Voting for Player3 will help reduce suspicion on myself and allow the game to progress.
  4. I need to distance myself from Player3's accusations and redirect the conversation towards more neutral topics. I should also try to appear cooperative and helpful, while keeping an eye on the most suspicious players.
  5. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and reduce suspicion on myself. I should try to appear cooperative and helpful while keeping an eye on the most suspicious players, like Player4 who has a high suspicion score and has been making convenient suggestions.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to start gathering information about the other players and their behavior. I will try to appear friendly and non-suspicious while also subtly questioning the players.
  2. As a villager, I want to focus on gathering information about the other players and their behavior. I will try to build a rapport with the players and see if anyone is willing to share any information about the events of the previous night.
  3. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I believe Player3 is the most suspicious player and should be voted out. They have consistently high suspicion scores and have made statements that seem suspiciously convenient.
  4. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I believe Player4 is the most suspicious player and should be investigated further. Their suggestion to discuss the layout of the village and potential hiding spots for the werewolves seems suspiciously convenient.
