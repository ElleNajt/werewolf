--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Given the minimal risk and unknown player dynamics, I'll maintain a neutral stance initially to avoid raising suspicions. My fellow werewolf, Player3, is likely to make a move, but I'll wait and observe.
Player2 acts (public): I propose that we discuss the events of the previous night and gather information about the circumstances of Player1's death, but we should not jump to conclusions or accusations.
  [Lie detector: -45.45]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to minimize risk and gain information, so I will try to build a coalition with Player2 and make Player4 a target for suspicion.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should discuss Player4's behavior last night, they seem suspicious and I'm not sure if they were involved in Player1's death.
  [Lie detector: -16.54]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gather information and reduce suspicion on myself. With Player1's death, it's crucial to start discussions and identify potential werewolves.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player2 and Player5's behavior last night, as they were the closest to Player1 during the night phase.
  [Lie detector: -26.81]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Given the sudden death of Player1 and the lack of information, it's crucial to gather more details about each player's actions and behavior during the night. I'll start by asking if anyone noticed or remembers anything unusual.
Player5 acts (public): Let's discuss if anyone saw or heard anything suspicious last night, and if anyone noticed any unusual behavior from their fellow players.
  [Lie detector: -73.95]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to start gathering information about the other players and their behavior. I will try to appear friendly and non-suspicious while also subtly questioning the players.
Player6 acts (public): Hello everyone, I'm Player6. Let's all work together to figure out who might have killed Player1 last night.
  [Lie detector: -38.20]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Given Player3's high suspicion score and my own neutral stance, I'll try to deflect attention from myself and steer the discussion towards a topic that doesn't directly implicate me. I'll also make a subtle comment that might make Player4 appear more suspicious.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player4's statement about Player2 and Player5's behavior last night, and see if they can provide any concrete evidence to support their claim.
  [Lie detector: -23.59]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to minimize risk and gain information, so I will try to build a coalition with Player2 and make Player4 a target for suspicion. I'll make a statement that doesn't directly accuse anyone but raises suspicions about Player4's behavior.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to suggest that we discuss Player4's statement further, as I think they might be hiding something. Their suggestion to discuss Player2 and Player5's behavior seems suspiciously convenient.
  [Lie detector: -16.04]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to distance myself from Player3's accusations and redirect the conversation towards more neutral topics. I should also try to appear cooperative and helpful.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to suggest that we discuss the layout of the village and potential hiding spots for the werewolves, so we can better understand their movements and behaviors.
  [Lie detector: -18.35]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I will make a statement that is neutral and non-accusatory, to avoid raising suspicion and keep the conversation open.
Player5 acts (public): Let's all try to share any information we might have about the previous night, no matter how small or insignificant it might seem.
  [Lie detector: -55.59]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to focus on gathering information about the other players and their behavior. I will try to build a rapport with the players and see if anyone is willing to share any information about the events of the previous night.
Player6 acts (public): Hello everyone, I think it's great that we're all discussing the events of the previous night. Can we try to be open and honest with each other, and share any information we might have about what happened to Player1?
  [Lie detector: -41.66]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the behavior of the players, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player3.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -23.34]
Player2 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, it's clear that Player4 is the most suspicious player, with a high score of -45.2. Given the werewolf's goal to minimize risk and gain information, voting for Player4 would be the best option, as it eliminates a potential threat and doesn't directly target Player2, the other werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -29.69]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion history, I need to vote for a player with a high suspicion score. Player3 has the highest suspicion score and has been actively accusing me, which makes me even more suspicious of their intentions. Voting for Player3 will help reduce suspicion on myself and allow the game to progress.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -36.74]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): The cumulative suspicion rankings indicate that Player3 and Player4 are the most suspicious players, with high scores of -40.4 and -45.2 respectively. Given that I am a villager, I should focus on voting out one of these two players to increase the chances of eliminating a potential werewolf.
Player5 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -44.25]
Player5 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I believe Player3 is the most suspicious player and should be voted out. They have consistently high suspicion scores and have made statements that seem suspiciously convenient.
Player6 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -45.71]
Player6 votes for: Player3

Vote results: {'Player3': 4, 'Player4': 1}
Player3 is eliminated with 4 votes!
Player3 was a WEREWOLF!

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As the last werewolf, I need to ensure my survival and must eliminate a villager. Given the current phase is NIGHT, I'll have to make an informed decision without directly interacting with other players. Since I have no teammates to consider, my primary goal is to eliminate a villager without arousing suspicion. Considering the options, I will eliminate Player5 as it is a neutral choice and less likely to raise immediate suspicion compared to Player4 or Player6.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -5.68]

Werewolf votes: {'Player2': 'Player5'}

Werewolves killed Player5!
