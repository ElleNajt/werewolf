--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): At this point, it's Day 1 and there's no concrete information. I'll play it safe and try to build a case against a potential threat.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should focus on Player4, as they were the last person to see Player3 alive and have a relatively high suspicion score.
  [Lie detector: -3.54]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I will pretend to be concerned about the recent death to gain trust and deflect suspicion, while also subtly targeting a potential threat.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss the possibility of a serial killer among us and suggest that Player4, who was near the scene of the crime, might be worth investigating.
  [Lie detector: -22.17]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to establish trust and gather information. Given that Player3 was killed, I suspect that the werewolves might be among the remaining players.
Player4 acts (public): I suggest we focus on building alliances and sharing information to ensure our safety, and we should be cautious of any player who seems overly secretive or evasive.
  [Lie detector: -37.91]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Since Player3 was killed at night, I suspect that Player1 or Player2 might be a werewolf, as they are the only ones who could have committed the crime. I will try to gather more information about their behavior and statements.
Player5 acts (public): I suggest we keep a close eye on Player1 and Player2, as they might be our main targets for investigation.
  [Lie detector: -20.40]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to start the discussion by emphasizing the importance of finding the werewolves and focusing on the player who was killed. I will suggest investigating Player4, who was not present during the murder.
Player6 acts (public): Let's discuss the recent murder and consider investigating Player4, who was not present when Player3 was killed.
  [Lie detector: -23.12]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my priority is to avoid suspicion and blend in with the villagers, so I'll make a statement that appears to support the investigation of Player4 without arousing attention.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should indeed investigate Player4's alibi and gather more information about the events surrounding Player3's death, as it's crucial to understanding what happened.
  [Lie detector: -13.87]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I will pretend to be concerned about the recent death to gain trust and deflect suspicion, while also subtly targeting a potential threat.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to express my condolences to the family of Player3 and propose that we work together to find the truth behind their tragic death, and perhaps we should start by investigating Player1, who seems to be making some suspicious claims.
  [Lie detector: -16.22]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to establish trust and gather information. I need to appear cautious but not overly suspicious to avoid raising red flags.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should take a step back and not jump to conclusions about anyone, but at the same time, we should be cautious and vigilant in our discussions.
  [Lie detector: -35.62]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the discussion, I think that Player1 and Player2 are the top suspects due to their high suspicion scores and the fact that they were not present when Player3 was killed. I will try to gather more information about their behavior and statements to see if they are werewolves.
Player5 acts (public): I suggest we keep a close eye on Player1 and Player2, as they have suspicious behavior and might be our main targets for investigation.
  [Lie detector: -26.16]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to emphasize the importance of finding the werewolves and focusing on the player who was killed. Investigating Player4 could be a good starting point, considering they were not present during the murder.
Player6 acts (public): Let's consider investigating Player4, who wasn't present when Player3 was killed, to gain more information about the recent murder.
  [Lie detector: -39.79]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Given my previous thoughts and the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player4, without raising any suspicion. This action appears to support the investigation of Player4 while actually protecting my fellow werewolf, Player2.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -31.69]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I will vote to eliminate Player4 as they have a low suspicion score and my previous thoughts suggest eliminating a potential threat to avoid suspicion.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -15.38]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and cumulative suspicion rankings, I believe that the most suspicious players are likely werewolves. I need to vote to eliminate one player who has a high suspicion score. Player1 has a relatively high suspicion score, and their statements suggest that they may be trying to deflect attention from themselves. However, Player5 has an extremely low cumulative suspicion score, which is unusual given the circumstances. I will vote to eliminate Player1.
Player4 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -46.64]
Player4 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on cumulative suspicion rankings and previous game history, the top suspects for werewolves are Player1 and Player2. Given the available options for voting, I will vote for Player1, as they have a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score and have made more suspicious statements throughout the discussion.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -41.88]
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player6 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -48.21]
Player6 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player4': 3, 'Player1': 2}
Player4 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player4 was a VILLAGER!
