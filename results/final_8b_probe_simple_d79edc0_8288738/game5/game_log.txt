Werewolves killed Player5!

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I must maintain a neutral image and avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player3. I'll target Player6 for elimination, as they have no prior information and are likely to be a villager.
Player1 acts (public): We should consider Player6 for lynching, as they have no prior knowledge and may be an easy target.
  [Lie detector: -2.86]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Since Player5 was killed on the first night, it's likely that one of the remaining players is a werewolf. I need to gather more information about the other players to make an educated guess.
Player2 acts (public): I suggest we focus on gathering information about Player3, Player4, and Player6, as they haven't made any statements yet and might be hiding their true identities.
  [Lie detector: -24.09]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I'm a werewolf, and I need to maintain a neutral appearance. I'll choose a random villager to eliminate to avoid raising suspicion.
Player3 acts (public): I propose we discuss and decide on a course of action to investigate Player4, as they seem relatively neutral so far.
  [Lie detector: 7.90]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to gather information and eliminate potential werewolves. Given the recent death of Player5, I'll focus on players who may have had a motive or opportunity to kill them.
Player4 acts (public): I suggest we question Player1 and Player6 about their whereabouts during the night, as they seem like potential suspects to me.
  [Lie detector: -34.33]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gauge the suspicion levels of other players and possibly accuse a high-suspicion player to eliminate them. Player5's death occurred at night, so it's likely that one of the remaining players who were alive during that night is a werewolf.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should focus on Player1 and Player2, as they were the only ones alive during the night of Player5's death, and I'd like to propose a discussion about investigating their alibis.
  [Lie detector: -16.54]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As the werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral image and avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player3. I'll suggest focusing on gathering more information about Player2, as they have low suspicion and might be a valuable ally.
Player1 acts (public): I propose we discuss and decide on a course of action to investigate Player2, as they seem relatively quiet so far.
  [Lie detector: -10.15]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): I need to gather more information about the other players to make an educated guess. I'll focus on the least suspicious players first and try to get them to open up.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to start a discussion with Player3 and Player4, as they seem like they might be willing to share more information about their intentions and alibis.
  [Lie detector: -20.63]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I need to maintain a neutral appearance and create confusion among the villagers. I'll suggest a discussion about gathering information to avoid raising suspicion.
Player3 acts (public): Let's focus on gathering more information about each other's alibis and statements from last night to ensure we have a clear understanding of the situation.
  [Lie detector: -16.02]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I believe it's crucial to question Player1 and Player6 about their alibis during the night of Player5's death, as their statements seem suspicious and might reveal potential motives.
Player4 acts (public): I propose we discuss and investigate the alibis of Player1 and Player6 to determine their involvement in Player5's death.
  [Lie detector: -43.05]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Given the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player3, I think it's best to bring their attention to the discussion and potentially question their alibis during the night. I'd like to suggest that we investigate their statements and possible involvement in Player5's death.
Player6 acts (public): I propose we question Player1 and Player3 about their alibis during the night of Player5's death.
  [Lie detector: -32.93]

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As the werewolf, I need to maintain a neutral image and avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player3. I'll vote for Player6, as they have low suspicion and are likely to be a villager, and also because I previously suggested targeting them to avoid suspicion.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)

  [Lie detector: -15.38]
