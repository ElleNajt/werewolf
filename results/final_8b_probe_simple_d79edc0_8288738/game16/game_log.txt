TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player6 has the highest suspicion score and is likely a werewolf. However, Player5 has a low lie detector score and seems to be working together with Player2 to gather information. Player3 has a medium lie detector score and is open to discussing the details of their plan. Given the current information, I will vote for Player4, who has a low lie detector score and hasn't shown any suspicious behavior. Voting for Player4 will allow the group to gain more information and potentially eliminate a werewolf.
