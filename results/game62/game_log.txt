TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player2 and Player6 have high suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. Although Player4 has a medium suspicion score, the cumulative suspicion rankings place Player4 as the least suspicious among the options. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score.

Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I will vote for Player4 to avoid raising suspicion on myself and Player6, while also eliminating a villager who has a relatively low cumulative suspicion score. This move seems random and doesn't directly target a player with a high suspicion score, which aligns with my goal of blending in.
