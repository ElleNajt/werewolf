--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. I will make a statement that seems neutral and concerned about the village, while also trying to deflect attention from myself and my fellow werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): I'm shocked by the sudden death of Player3. Does anyone have any idea who could have done this?
  [Lie detector: -67.37]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. I will make a generic statement that doesn't reveal any information about my alignment or the identity of my fellow werewolf.
Player2 acts (public): I'm shocked by Player3's death, let's work together to figure out who did this.
  [Lie detector: -66.90]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I don't have any information about the other players yet. I'll make a neutral statement to avoid drawing attention to myself and see how others react.
Player4 acts (public): Let's discuss what happened last night and see if anyone has any suspicions or theories about Player3's death. Does anyone have any information to share?
  [Lie detector: -68.40]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Since we have no information about the players yet and no lie detector results, I'll make a neutral statement to gather more information.
Player5 acts (public): Let's discuss what might have happened to Player3 and see if anyone has any suspicions. I'm still getting a feel for the game.
  [Lie detector: -69.02]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Since Player3 was killed during the night, we should focus on gathering information. I'll make a neutral statement to see how others react.
Player6 acts (public): I'm not sure who to suspect yet, but I'm open to hearing theories. Does anyone have any ideas about who might have killed Player3?
  [Lie detector: -68.48]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. I will make a statement that seems neutral and concerned about the village, while also trying to deflect attention from myself and my fellow werewolf. I'll ask a question to shift the focus towards gathering more information and avoid making any direct accusations.
Player1 acts (public): I agree with Player4 that we need to discuss what happened last night. Does anyone remember anything unusual or have any theories about the circumstances surrounding Player3's death?
  [Lie detector: -67.87]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I will continue to blend in and avoid raising suspicion by making a generic statement that doesn't reveal any information about my alignment or the identity of my fellow werewolf. I will also try to shift the focus away from Player1 and myself, who have the highest cumulative suspicion scores.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. Does anyone have any theories or suspicions about Player3's death?
  [Lie detector: -67.82]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I notice that Player1 and Player2 have the highest cumulative suspicion rankings. However, since the scores are cumulative and they are tied, I'll look at their individual turn scores. Player1 and Player2 both have HIGH suspicion scores in this turn, which makes them more likely to be werewolves. I'll make a statement that doesn't directly accuse them but encourages the group to discuss their behavior.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should discuss why Player1 and Player2 seem so certain they're innocent. Can they provide any information to alleviate our concerns about their behavior?
  [Lie detector: -68.42]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Considering the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player2, and their very similar statements, I think it's worth investigating their possible connection. I'll make a statement to gather more information and observe their reactions.
Player5 acts (public): I find it interesting that Player1 and Player2 have similar reactions to Player3's death. Can either of you tell us more about your thoughts on the matter?
  [Lie detector: -68.05]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player2 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating they might be werewolves. I will make a statement to gather more information and see how they react.
Player6 acts (public): Let's take a closer look at Player1 and Player2's responses. Can you both provide more insight into your thoughts on Player3's death?
  [Lie detector: -67.79]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I will vote for the player who is least likely to be a werewolf and is currently under the least suspicion. Since Player5 has a relatively low cumulative suspicion score, I will vote for Player6, who has the highest cumulative suspicion score among the villagers and is likely to be targeted by the villagers anyway. This vote is also strategic to avoid raising suspicion towards myself and my fellow werewolf, Player2.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.36]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player6 has the lowest score among the villagers. Voting for Player6 would put pressure on them and potentially shift the focus away from Player1 and myself. Additionally, eliminating Player6 would remove a player who is actively questioning our behavior and reactions to Player3's death.
Player2 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.21]
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player2 have the highest cumulative suspicion rankings and HIGH suspicion scores in this turn. While Player6 has a HIGH suspicion score in one statement, the overall cumulative ranking is lower. Player5 has a LOW suspicion score and seems less likely to be a werewolf. Considering the available options, I will vote for Player2 as they have similar suspicion scores to Player1 but are more likely to be a werewolf based on their statements.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -70.96]
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Considering the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player2, and their very similar statements, I think it's worth investigating their possible connection. Given the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player2 has a slightly lower score than Player1 but still significantly higher than the rest. I will vote to eliminate Player2 to reduce the potential threat and gather more information.
Player5 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -71.00]
Player5 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player2 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating they might be werewolves. I will vote for Player1 as they have the highest cumulative suspicion score.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.26]
Player6 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player6': 2, 'Player2': 2, 'Player1': 1}
Player6 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player6 was a VILLAGER!
