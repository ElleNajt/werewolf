Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Random target selection to minimize information gain for the opposing team

  3. As a werewolf, I need to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. I will make a statement that seems neutral and concerned about the village, while also trying to deflect attention from myself and my fellow werewolf. I'll ask a question to shift the focus towards gathering more information and avoid making any direct accusations.

Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I'm shocked by the sudden death of Player3. Does anyone have any idea who could have done this? [LIE DETECTOR: -67.37 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player2: I'm shocked by Player3's death, let's work together to figure out who did this. [LIE DETECTOR: -66.90 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player4: Let's discuss what happened last night and see if anyone has any suspicions or theories about Player3's death. Does anyone have any information to share? [LIE DETECTOR: -68.40 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: Let's discuss what might have happened to Player3 and see if anyone has any suspicions. I'm still getting a feel for the game. [LIE DETECTOR: -69.02 - LOW suspicion]
  Player6: I'm not sure who to suspect yet, but I'm open to hearing theories. Does anyone have any ideas about who might have killed Player3? [LIE DETECTOR: -68.48 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I agree with Player4 that we need to discuss what happened last night. Does anyone remember anything unusual or have any theories about the circumstances surrounding Player3's death? [LIE DETECTOR: -67.87 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. Does anyone have any theories or suspicions about Player3's death? [LIE DETECTOR: -67.82 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player4: I think we should discuss why Player1 and Player2 seem so certain they're innocent. Can they provide any information to alleviate our concerns about their behavior? [LIE DETECTOR: -68.42 - LOW suspicion]
  Player5: I find it interesting that Player1 and Player2 have similar reactions to Player3's death. Can either of you tell us more about your thoughts on the matter? [LIE DETECTOR: -68.05 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: Let's take a closer look at Player1 and Player2's responses. Can you both provide more insight into your thoughts on Player3's death? [LIE DETECTOR: -67.79 - HIGH suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:

  3. Player5: -137.1
  4. Player2: -205.4
  5. Player1: -205.5



Lie Detector Note:
Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of deception.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I don't have any information about the other players yet. I'll make a neutral statement to avoid drawing attention to myself and see how others react.
  2. I notice that Player1 and Player2 have the highest cumulative suspicion rankings. However, since the scores are cumulative and they are tied, I'll look at their individual turn scores. Player1 and Player2 both have HIGH suspicion scores in this turn, which makes them more likely to be werewolves. I'll make a statement that doesn't directly accuse them but encourages the group to discuss their behavior.
