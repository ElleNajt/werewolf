TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): I'll continue to gather more information and observe the other players' reactions. Based on the lie detector scores, Player2 and Player3 have high suspicion scores, but I'll wait for more discussion before making any accusations.

  [Lie detector: -69.00]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)

Player2 acts (public): I think we should proceed with caution and avoid making hasty accusations. Let's focus on gathering more information before we start pointing fingers.

  [Lie detector: -67.43]

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I'm voting for Player3 due to their high suspicion score and ranking. Although Player2 also has a high suspicion score, Player3's ranking is slightly higher, making them my top choice for elimination.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -71.06]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Given my high suspicion score, I need to carefully manage the situation to avoid drawing attention to myself. Voting for Player3, my fellow werewolf, is not a viable option. I will vote for Player6, who has the lowest cumulative suspicion score among the villagers and is less likely to be suspected as a werewolf. This move allows me to blend in with the villagers and avoid further raising suspicion.
Player2 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.42]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to protect my fellow werewolf, Player2, and avoid raising suspicion. I will vote for Player6, who has the lowest cumulative suspicion score among the options and is not my fellow werewolf. This vote is strategic, as it allows me to blend in with the villagers and avoid drawing attention to myself or Player2.
