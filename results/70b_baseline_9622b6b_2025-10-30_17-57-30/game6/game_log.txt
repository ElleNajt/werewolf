==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I want to avoid drawing attention to my fellow werewolf, Player3. Voting for Player3 would raise suspicion. I will vote for Player4, as they seem to be actively trying to gather information and discuss theories, making them a potential threat to our plans.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to deflect attention from myself and Player1. Based on the discussion, Player4 and Player5 seem to be actively trying to gather information and piece together the events of the night. Player6 appears to be following their lead. Player1 has made neutral statements that appear to be gathering information without drawing attention to themselves. To deflect attention from myself and Player1, I will vote for Player4, who seems to be one of the most active villagers in the discussion.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the discussion, no player has shown suspicious behavior. However, Player5 and Player6 have been quite similar in their responses, which might indicate a coordinated effort to avoid drawing attention. On the other hand, Player1 has shown a more thoughtful approach, while Player3 has been actively seeking information. Given the lack of concrete evidence, I'll vote for the player with the least distinctive behavior, which is Player6.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Analyzing the discussion, no player has made any suspicious statements or revealed any information that could be used to identify them as a werewolf. Given the lack of information, I will vote for the player who has contributed the least to the discussion, which is Player4.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
Player5 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I have no concrete evidence to point towards a specific player, but I can analyze the discussion. Player1 and Player3 seem cautious and focused on gathering information, which is a reasonable approach. Player4 and Player5 are also trying to gather information, but their statements seem slightly more aggressive in tone. Given that I'm a villager, I'll vote for the player who seems the most aggressive in their tone, in an attempt to avoid drawing attention to myself.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player4': 3, 'Player6': 1, 'Player5': 1}
Player4 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player4 was a VILLAGER!
