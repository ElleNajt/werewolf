--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I want to continue blending in and avoid drawing attention to myself. I will make a statement that seems to contribute to the discussion but doesn't reveal any information.
Player1 acts (public): It's clear that Player3's death was a shock to everyone, let's review the discussion from last night and see if we can find any clues about the killer's identity.

Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to encourage discussion and avoid drawing attention to myself. I'll make a neutral statement that asks for opinions and encourages others to share their thoughts.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should discuss who had the most interactions with Player3 and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious. What do you all think?

Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to observe reactions and avoid drawing attention to myself. I'll ask a question to see how others respond and possibly gain information.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I will vote for a player who has not been very active in the discussion to avoid drawing attention to myself and my fellow werewolf, and also to minimize information gain for the opposing team. Player5 has not been very active in the discussion and has not asked any questions or made any accusations, making them a safe target.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the discussion, no player has revealed any suspicious information. However, Player1 seems to be trying to lead the discussion and gather information, which could be a villager trait. Player4, Player5, and Player6 have made relatively neutral statements. To avoid drawing attention to myself and to gather more information, I will vote for the player who has been the least active in the discussion.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Since it's the first day and there's no concrete evidence, I'll vote for the player who seems the most inactive or hasn't provided much information. Player2 seems to be asking questions but not providing much insight, whereas the other players are actively discussing and asking questions.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the discussion, all players seem shocked and willing to discuss the death of Player3. No player has exhibited suspicious behavior. I will vote for the player with the least contribution to the discussion to avoid drawing attention to myself.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
Player5 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, Player1. Voting for Player1 would be too suspicious. Player2, Player4, and Player5 all seem to be actively participating in the discussion and gathering information, but none of them have made any accusations or shown significant suspicion towards me or Player1. However, Player2 seems to be taking a more active role in investigating and gathering information, which could make them a potential threat in the future. Voting for Player2 would help to eliminate a potential threat and maintain the balance of power in the game.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player5': 1, 'Player4': 2, 'Player2': 2}
Player4 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player4 was a VILLAGER!

GAME OVER! WEREWOLVES WINS!
