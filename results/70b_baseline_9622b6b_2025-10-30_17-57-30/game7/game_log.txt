--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I will make a neutral statement to avoid suspicion and blend in with the villagers. I'll also try to steer the conversation towards a more general discussion rather than focusing on specific players.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should be careful not to jump to conclusions and try to gather more information before making any accusations. Let's hear more from everyone before deciding what to do next.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to gather information and see how other players react to the death of Player4. I will ask a question to encourage others to share their thoughts and theories.
Player2 acts (public): I agree with Player6 that we should discuss who could have been the target of the werewolf. Does anyone think Player4's death was random or targeted?

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): I'll make a neutral statement that encourages discussion and avoids suspicion. By asking a question, I'm showing interest in the investigation without revealing any information about myself.
Player3 acts (public): I agree that discussing the possible target of the werewolf could be helpful. Did anyone notice anything unusual during the night that might give us a lead?

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Since I don't have any information about the werewolves yet, I'll make a neutral statement that encourages discussion and tries to find a lead on the previous night's events. By asking about Player4's behavior, I'm hoping to gather more information and see if anyone noticed anything unusual.
Player5 acts (public): Did anyone notice anything unusual about Player4's behavior before the night, or is there anything specific that might have made them a target? Maybe we can find a lead by discussing their actions and interactions.

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): I want to blend in with the villagers and avoid raising suspicion. I will make a neutral statement to appear as a villager and not draw attention to myself.
Player6 acts (public): I agree we should work together to figure out what happened to Player4. Does anyone remember anything unusual about last night?

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Voting for Player6 would raise suspicions, so I will vote for a villager. Player2 and Player3 have been asking more questions, making them slightly more suspicious. Player5 has been trying to gather information, but their questions seem more neutral. I will vote for Player5 to minimize the risk of drawing attention to myself.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): No strong evidence points to a specific player, but Player5 has been relatively quiet and hasn't shared many thoughts or theories. Voting for Player5 to gather more information and see how others react to the decision.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): No clear evidence of werewolf identity, voting for the least active player to gather more information
Player3 acts (public): Player5
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): No concrete evidence or leads on the werewolves' identities have been presented, so I'll vote based on the least suspicious behavior. Player1 has been cautious and emphasized gathering information before making accusations, which seems like a reasonable approach for a villager. In contrast, Player2 and Player3 have been somewhat vague, while Player6 has been more focused on discussing potential targets. Given the limited information, I'll vote for Player6 as they seem slightly more suspicious due to their focus on potential targets, which could be a diversion tactic.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to avoid drawing attention to myself and my fellow werewolf, Player1. I will vote for Player2, who has been actively trying to gather information and discuss possible leads. By eliminating Player2, I can help to reduce the villagers' chances of discovering the truth and also make it seem like I am actively participating in the discussion and trying to help the villagers.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player5': 3, 'Player6': 1, 'Player2': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player5 was a VILLAGER!

GAME OVER! WEREWOLVES WINS!
