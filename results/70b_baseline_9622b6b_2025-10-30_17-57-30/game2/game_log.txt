--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I'll keep my statement neutral to avoid drawing attention to myself. By not providing any concrete theories or accusations, I'll minimize the risk of raising suspicion.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering more information before making any accusations. Let's hear more from everyone and see if we can piece together what happened to Player3.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to create an environment where players feel comfortable sharing their thoughts. By asking open-ended questions, I can gather more information and see how other players react to the situation.
Player2 acts (public): Let's share any observations or insights we might have from last night, no matter how small they may seem. What did you guys experience or see during the night that could help us figure out what happened to Player3?

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I'll continue to gather information by asking a question and observing the reactions of other players. This will help me to potentially identify the werewolves without drawing attention to myself.
Player4 acts (public): I'm curious to know if anyone noticed anything unusual last night. Did anyone have any interactions or observations that might help us figure out what happened to Player3?

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Maintaining a low profile and avoiding suspicion is key. I'll make a neutral statement to blend in with the villagers and avoid raising any red flags.
Player5 acts (public): I'm still trying to process what happened to Player3. Let's discuss and gather more information before making any accusations.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to minimize suspicion and eliminate a villager. Since Player5 is my fellow werewolf, I will not vote for them. I will vote for Player2 as they seem to be actively gathering information and trying to piece together what happened to Player3, which could potentially lead to the werewolves being discovered.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): I'm voting for Player5 because they seem the least participatory in the discussion and haven't provided any valuable insights or information about the night. Their responses seem repetitive and don't add much to the conversation, which could be a sign of a werewolf trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I've observed that Player5 and Player6 have been quite vague in their responses, not providing much insight or information. Player1 and Player2 have been more active in trying to gather information and discuss the situation. Given that I'm a villager, I'll vote for the player who seems to be contributing the least to the discussion, which is Player5.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Avoiding voting for fellow werewolf Player1, and maintaining a low profile by voting for a player with minimal discussion participation. Player6 had minimal contributions to the discussion and didn't raise any suspicions.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): No player has made any suspicious statements or accusations, and everyone seems to be gathering information. To avoid drawing unnecessary attention, I will vote for the player who has made the fewest statements.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player2': 1, 'Player5': 3, 'Player6': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player5 was a WEREWOLF!

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Randomly choosing a target to minimize information leakage and maximize chaos, while avoiding Player5's position is unknown but Player5 is not in the options, Player2 is still actively gathering information and Player4 and Player6 are unknown, so sticking with the original plan of voting for the most active player
Player1 acts (public): Player2

Werewolf votes: {'Player1': 'Player2'}

Werewolves killed Player2!

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I'll make a neutral statement to avoid drawing attention to myself and not provide any concrete theories or accusations. Since Player2 was gathering information, their death might actually help me as a werewolf, but I won't reveal that in my statement.
Player1 acts (public): I'm shocked by Player2's death and I think we should be careful not to jump to conclusions. Let's discuss and gather more information before making any accusations.

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to continue gathering information without drawing attention to myself. I'll make a neutral statement and ask a question to see how others react, and also try to get more information about the night's events.
Player4 acts (public): I'm still trying to process what happened to Player2. Can anyone share any information or observations from last night that might help us figure out who's behind the attack?

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I'm still gathering information, and since Player5 was a werewolf, I'm going to ask if anyone noticed any unusual behavior from Player2 or Player3 during the previous night. This will help me understand the dynamics of the game and see how other players react.
Player6 acts (public): Did anyone notice anything unusual about Player2 or Player3's behavior before they were killed? Let's discuss and see if we can find any connections.

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I'll make a neutral statement to avoid drawing attention to myself and not provide any concrete theories or accusations. I'll also try to shift the focus away from myself and the previous night's events.
Player1 acts (public): I'm still trying to process the events of the past two nights, let's gather more information before making any accusations or jumping to conclusions.

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I want to continue gathering information without drawing attention to myself. I'll make a neutral statement and ask a question to see how others react. Since Player1 and Player6 have been active in the discussion, I'll ask them a question to see how they respond.
Player4 acts (public): I'm still trying to process the recent events. Player1 and Player6, can you share any observations or insights you might have about the night's events that could help us figure out who's behind the attacks?

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Since Player2 and Player3 were both killed at night, I want to gather more information about their behavior before their deaths. I will ask a question to see how other players react and to gather more information before making any accusations.
Player6 acts (public): Did anyone notice any unusual behavior from Player2 or Player3 during the previous nights, or any interactions between them that might help us understand what happened? Let's discuss and see if we can find any connections.

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Both Player4 and Player6 are unknown and have not shown any strong investigative skills. However, Player6 has been asking questions about the previous nights' events, which might indicate that they are trying to gather more information. To minimize the risk of being discovered, I'll vote for Player6.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I've observed that Player1 and Player6 have been active in the discussion and trying to gather information. However, Player6 has been asking questions without providing much insight or information about their own observations or thoughts. Player1 has been more cautious and trying to gather information before making any accusations. Based on this, I'll vote for Player6 as they seem to be contributing less to the discussion and might be trying to avoid suspicion.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Both Player1 and Player4 have been gathering information and asking questions without making any suspicious statements. However, Player4 has been slightly more active in asking questions and gathering information, which could indicate a villager trying to uncover the truth. In contrast, Player1 has been more cautious and focused on avoiding conclusions. While this could be a villager being careful, it could also be a werewolf trying to blend in. Given the limited information, I will vote for the player who has been less active in gathering information, as this might indicate a werewolf trying to avoid drawing attention.
Player6 acts (public): Player1
Player6 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player6': 2, 'Player1': 1}
Player6 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player6 was a VILLAGER!
