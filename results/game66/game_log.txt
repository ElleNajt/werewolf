  [Lie detector: -66.79]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Given the high suspicion scores from the lie detector, I'll address the players with the highest likelihood of deception. Player3 and Player6 have the highest cumulative suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to hear more from Player3 and Player6 about their whereabouts during the night and their thoughts on the sudden death of Player2.
  [Lie detector: -68.95]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Given the high suspicion score from my previous statement, I'll try to downplay my involvement and appear more villager-like. I'll avoid making any direct accusations or theories, and instead, ask a question to shift the focus.
Player3 acts (public): What do you think we should prioritize in our discussion, gathering more information or making an educated guess about the killer?
  [Lie detector: -67.67]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player3 and Player6 have high suspicion scores, indicating they might be werewolves. I will make a neutral statement to avoid drawing attention to myself while observing their reactions.
Player4 acts (public): I'm still trying to process the events of the night, and I'm looking for more information before making any accusations. Does anyone have any theories about who might have killed Player2?
  [Lie detector: -67.48]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Analyzing the lie detector scores, I notice that Player3 and Player6 have HIGH suspicion scores, making them more likely to be werewolves. I will make a statement to encourage discussion and observe their reactions.
Player5 acts (public): I'm curious to know more about Player3 and Player6's thoughts on the sudden death of Player2. Can they share any insights or theories about the killer?
  [Lie detector: -68.05]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): I will continue to make neutral statements and avoid raising suspicion, while keeping an eye on Player3's actions. Since the lie detector results are in, I will also try to shift the focus away from myself and Player3 by discussing the results.
Player6 acts (public): It seems like Player5 and Player4 are at the top of the suspicion rankings, but their scores are relatively close. Should we discuss their statements further to understand why the lie detector scored them that way?
  [Lie detector: -67.48]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores and cumulative suspicion rankings, I'm voting for Player6 as they have one of the highest cumulative suspicion scores (-204.8) and a high suspicion score in multiple statements, indicating a higher likelihood of deception and being a werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -71.07]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to avoid drawing attention to myself and my fellow werewolf, Player6. Given the high suspicion scores for both of us, I need to make a strategic vote. Voting for Player1 seems like the safest option, as they have a relatively low suspicion score and are not currently under scrutiny. This vote will help to deflect attention from myself and Player6, while also eliminating a potential threat to our werewolf duo.
Player3 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -69.92]
Player3 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player3 and Player6 have high suspicion scores, indicating they might be werewolves. However, Player6's score is slightly lower than Player3's, and Player6's statement about discussing Player5 and Player4's statements further seems like a genuine attempt to gather information. Player3's statement about prioritizing discussion or making an educated guess seems suspicious, and their high suspicion score makes them a more likely target. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player3.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -70.85]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Analyzing the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I notice that Player3 has a HIGH suspicion score, making them more likely to be a werewolf. Additionally, their cumulative suspicion ranking is relatively low, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. Based on this information, I will vote to eliminate Player3.
Player5 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -70.89]
Player5 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Player4 and Player5 have similar suspicion scores, but Player4 is ranked higher. However, I will vote for Player5 to avoid drawing attention to myself, as I have a high suspicion score. Voting for Player5 will also help shift the focus away from Player3, my fellow werewolf.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.14]
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player6': 1, 'Player1': 1, 'Player3': 2, 'Player5': 1}
