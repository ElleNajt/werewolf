  [Lie detector: -68.58]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)

  [Lie detector: -69.42]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Given the high suspicion scores for both Player1 and Player2, it's crucial to downplay any potential connections and avoid raising more suspicion. Since Player3 has a relatively high suspicion score, I will divert attention from myself and Player2 by making a neutral statement that also involves Player3 in the discussion.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should discuss possible motives and alibis for last night, and I'd like to hear more from Player3 about their thoughts on the matter. Does anyone have any theories about what might have driven the killer's actions?
  [Lie detector: -66.97]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I want to maintain a low suspicion score and avoid drawing attention to myself. Since Player1 and I both have high suspicion scores, I will try to deflect suspicion by commenting on Player1's high score without directly accusing them.
Player2 acts (public): I'm concerned that Player1's initial statement seemed somewhat rehearsed, but I'm not ready to make any accusations yet. Let's discuss further and see if we can uncover any leads.
  [Lie detector: -66.82]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): I need to carefully analyze the lie detector scores and the players' statements. Players 1 and 2 have high cumulative suspicion scores, but their initial statements seem neutral. I will make a statement to encourage discussion and observe their reactions.
Player3 acts (public): Let's analyze the lie detector scores and discuss possible connections between the players. Does anyone notice anything unusual about the scores or the players' behavior?
  [Lie detector: -68.76]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I will analyze the lie detector scores to guide my decision-making. Based on the scores, Player1 and Player2 have HIGH suspicion scores and are more likely to be werewolves. I will make a statement to encourage them to respond and provide more information.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to hear more from Player1 and Player2 regarding their reactions to Player4's death and their thoughts on the investigation. Can you provide more context or insights into what might have happened?
  [Lie detector: -68.25]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Considering the high suspicion scores of Player1 and Player2, I will try to gather more information from them while also being cautious of my own words. I'll make a statement that encourages discussion and doesn't reveal my own suspicions.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to hear more from Player1 and Player2, can you both share any information or observations about Player4's behavior or interactions before the night? What are your thoughts on the current situation?
  [Lie detector: -68.34]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I will vote for Player3 to divert attention from myself and Player2, and to eliminate a player with a relatively high suspicion score. By doing so, I can maintain a low profile and avoid raising more suspicion. Additionally, voting for Player3 will create a sense of randomness and make it more difficult for the villagers to identify the werewolves.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -70.17]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, I will vote for Player1 to deflect suspicion from myself and potentially create confusion among the villagers. Since Player1 is also a werewolf, this vote will not harm our team's chances, and it may help to reduce my own suspicion score by appearing to act against a suspicious player.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.28]
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 and Player2 have high suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being a werewolf. However, their initial statements seemed neutral, and I need more information to make a decision. Considering the scores and the discussion, I will vote for Player2, who has a slightly higher cumulative suspicion score and a HIGH suspicion score in their second statement.
Player3 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -70.75]
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)

Given the options, I choose to vote for the player with the higher cumulative suspicion ranking between the two, which is Player1.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -70.36]
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I am voting for Player1 due to their HIGH suspicion score and rehearsed initial statement, which raised concerns among other players. Additionally, Player1's reactions to Player4's death and their thoughts on the investigation have not alleviated my suspicions. Voting for Player1 will help to eliminate a potential werewolf and increase the chances of the villagers winning the game.

Player6 acts (public): I'd like to hear more from Player2 about their thoughts on the current situation and Player5's death, and I'm also interested in Player3's analysis of the lie detector scores and how they think it can help us identify the werewolves.

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player3 has the lowest score, and voting for them might raise suspicions. Player6 has a slightly higher score, and voting for them could be seen as a legitimate attempt to eliminate a suspicious player. Additionally, Player6 has been asking questions and seeking information, which might make them appear more suspicious to the other villagers. Therefore, I will vote for Player6 to deflect suspicion from myself and potentially create confusion among the villagers.
Player2 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.15]
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)

In contrast, Player6 has a relatively low cumulative suspicion score and LOW suspicion scores in their statements, indicating a lower likelihood of being a werewolf. Given the information, it's more likely that Player2 is a werewolf and should be eliminated.
