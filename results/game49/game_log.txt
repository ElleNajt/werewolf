TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)

Player3 thinks (private): Both Player1 and Player4 have low cumulative suspicion scores and seem neutral, making them difficult to distinguish. However, Player1 has been more active in the discussion and has asked more questions, which might make them seem more suspicious in the future.
