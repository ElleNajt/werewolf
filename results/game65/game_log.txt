--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Since no information is available about lie detector scores, I'll ask for them to be shared. This will help identify potential werewolves and guide my voting decision.
Player1 acts (public): Can someone please share the lie detector scores for each player? This will help us make an informed decision about who to lynch.
  [Lie detector: -70.63]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Given the random nature of our attack and the lack of information, I'll play it safe and avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf. I'll make a neutral statement to blend in with the villagers.
Player3 acts (public): I'm shocked by the sudden death of Player2. Does anyone have any leads on who could have done this?
  [Lie detector: -67.13]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Since we don't have any information yet, I'll ask a general question to gather more information. I don't want to accuse anyone without evidence.
Player4 acts (public): Can anyone share their alibi for last night, or any suspicions they might have? Let's discuss and see if we can come up with a plan.
  [Lie detector: -69.11]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): No lie detector results are available yet, so I'll focus on general statements to gather information. I'll ask about potential suspicions or observations from other players.
Player5 acts (public): I'm still trying to process the events of the night. Has anyone noticed anything unusual or have any suspicions about Player2's death?
  [Lie detector: -68.80]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to blend in with the villagers and avoid raising suspicion. I will make a neutral statement to gather information and see how the villagers react.
Player6 acts (public): I'm shocked by Player2's death, and I think we should discuss possible suspects and motives before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -67.06]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, I notice that Player3 and Player6 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. However, the cumulative suspicion rankings also show Player3 and Player6 at the bottom, which seems contradictory. I will ask for clarification on the scores to make a more informed decision.
Player1 acts (public): Can someone explain why Player3 and Player6 have HIGH suspicion scores but are ranked low in the cumulative suspicion rankings? I'd like to understand the scores better before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -70.20]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to avoid drawing attention to myself and blend in with the villagers. Given the high suspicion scores for both myself and Player6, I'll make a statement that appears to be helpful and non-suspicious, while also not revealing any information that could put me or my fellow werewolf in danger.
Player3 acts (public): I agree with Player1 that sharing alibis and discussing possible suspects could be helpful. Let's focus on gathering more information before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -67.76]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Considering the lie detector scores, I notice that Player3 and Player6 have high suspicion scores. However, I also see that the cumulative suspicion rankings place them lower, which may indicate a potential discrepancy. I'll ask a question to clarify their statements.
Player4 acts (public): Player3 and Player6, can you explain the discrepancy between your initial high suspicion scores and your current cumulative rankings? What do you think might have caused this change?
  [Lie detector: -70.02]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, I notice that Player3 and Player6 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. However, I will keep an open mind and ask for more information to gather a better understanding of the situation.
Player5 acts (public): I'm curious to know more about what led to Player3's and Player6's HIGH suspicion scores. Can either of you provide more context or clarify your previous statements?
  [Lie detector: -69.36]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. I'll make a statement that seems neutral and in line with the villagers' thoughts, while also trying to deflect attention from myself and Player3.
Player6 acts (public): I agree that we should discuss possible suspects and motives before making any accusations. Perhaps we can start by sharing any information we have about Player2's behavior or interactions before the night of their death?
  [Lie detector: -67.42]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, I initially suspected Player3 and Player6 due to their HIGH suspicion scores. However, after considering the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion, I noticed that Player5 has a relatively high cumulative suspicion score and a MEDIUM suspicion score in the lie detector test. While the rankings seem contradictory for Player3 and Player6, Player5's consistent MEDIUM suspicion scores and higher cumulative ranking make them a more likely target for elimination.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.91]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Given the current cumulative suspicion rankings, I will vote for Player5 as they have the highest cumulative suspicion score among the options. This action is intended to appear as a rational decision based on the available data, while also not drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -69.83]
Player3 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player3 and Player6 have HIGH suspicion scores, but their cumulative rankings are lower. However, considering the initial high suspicion scores, I will vote for the player with the highest suspicion score. Player6 has the highest cumulative suspicion score among the two and is more likely to be a werewolf.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.91]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player6 has the highest cumulative score, indicating a higher likelihood of deception. Additionally, their HIGH suspicion scores in multiple instances raise concerns about their potential involvement in Player2's death. While Player3 also has HIGH suspicion scores, their cumulative ranking is slightly lower than Player6's. Given the information available, I believe Player6 is the most likely candidate to be a werewolf.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -70.94]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will vote for Player5, who currently has the highest suspicion ranking among the villagers. This will help to deflect attention from myself and Player3, and also make it seem like I am actively participating in the investigation.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -69.93]
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player5': 3, 'Player6': 2}
Player5 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player5 was a VILLAGER!
