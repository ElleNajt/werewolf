  [Lie detector: -68.40]

  [Lie detector: -68.34]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)

  [Lie detector: -67.67]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player5 and Player6 have the highest suspicion scores, indicating a higher likelihood of being werewolves. However, since Player6's last statement showed a slight decrease in suspicion score, I'll choose to vote for the player with the highest cumulative suspicion score, which is Player5.
Player1 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.75]
Player1 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player5 has the highest suspicion score, making them more likely to be a werewolf. Additionally, their responses seem evasive and focused on gathering more information without providing concrete theories or ideas. Given the HIGH suspicion score and the lack of concrete contributions to the discussion, I'm voting to eliminate Player5.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.74]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player5 and Player6 have HIGH suspicion scores, indicating a greater likelihood of being werewolves. Player5 has the highest cumulative suspicion score among the two. I will vote to eliminate Player5 to reduce the risk of a werewolf remaining in the game.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -70.88]
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): I'm choosing to vote for Player4 due to their relatively low suspicion score and neutral behavior during the discussion. Voting for Player4 also helps to shift the focus away from myself and Player6, who have higher suspicion scores. By eliminating Player4, I'm reducing the number of villagers and increasing our chances of survival as werewolves.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.21]
Player5 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. I will vote for the player with the lowest suspicion score, Player2, to appear neutral and non-confrontational. Voting for Player5 would raise suspicion, and voting for Player1 or Player4 might not be strategic, as they have relatively low suspicion scores as well. By voting for Player2, I can avoid drawing attention to myself and gather more information for future turns.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -70.54]
Player6 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player5': 3, 'Player4': 1, 'Player2': 1}
Player5 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player5 was a WEREWOLF!

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): As the last werewolf, my goal is to eliminate a player who could potentially discover my identity or gain an advantage. Voting for Player1 or Player4 might not be strategic, as they have relatively low suspicion scores. I will vote for Player2, but since Player2 was already voted out last turn, I will choose Player4 to appear neutral and non-confrontational, while also trying to gauge the reactions of the other players.
Player6 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -70.58]

Werewolf votes: {'Player6': 'Player4'}
