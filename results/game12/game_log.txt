==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Given the lack of information and lie detector readings, I will vote based on the process of elimination and the fact that no player has made any accusations or provided any concrete evidence. Since all players have made similar statements, I will randomly choose a player to vote for.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: 0.50]
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Since I don't have any information from the lie detector readings, I will vote for a player who seems less likely to be a threat to me or my fellow werewolf, Player11. Player1 has made a statement that seems to be trying to gather information from everyone, which could be a villager-like behavior, but it's also possible that they're trying to gain an advantage. However, without more information, I will choose to vote for Player1 as they seem to be taking a central role in the discussion, and eliminating them could reduce the village's ability to organize and make decisions.
Player2 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: 0.50]
Player2 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Since there's no concrete information or lie detector readings available, I'll rely on the process of elimination and general behavior. Most players have made similar statements, calling for discussion and information sharing. However, without any specific clues or suspicious behavior, I must consider the fact that no information is available for Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player6, Player7, Player8, Player9, Player10, Player11, and Player12's lie detector readings. Given the lack of data, I will choose a player who hasn't added significant value to the discussion or stands out in any way. Player12's statement seems somewhat generic and doesn't offer any new insights. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player12.
Player3 acts (public): Player12
  [Lie detector: 0.50]
Player3 votes for: Player12

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Since there's no concrete evidence or lie detector readings available, I'll vote based on the principle of encouraging discussion and avoiding suspicion. Players who haven't spoken up or haven't added much to the discussion could be considered suspicious. However, given that all players except Player5 (who is dead) have made statements, and they all seem to be calling for discussion and information sharing without revealing much, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific player. Therefore, I will choose a player who seems to be repeating the same idea without adding significant value to the discussion. Player10's statement seems somewhat redundant and doesn't offer new insights compared to others.
Player4 acts (public): Player10
  [Lie detector: 0.50]
Player4 votes for: Player10

[Calling agent for Player6] (seer)
Player6 thinks (private): As a seer, I investigated Player8 and found them to be innocent. Since all players are asking for information and no one has made any accusations, I will vote for a player who has not provided any unique insights or theories, to gather more information and avoid revealing my role. Player7 seems like a good choice, as they only asked for a discussion of events and did not provide any leads or suspicions.
Player6 acts (public): Player7
  [Lie detector: 0.50]
Player6 votes for: Player7

[Calling agent for Player7] (villager)
Player7 thinks (private): Since there's no concrete information about any player's role or suspicious behavior, and the lie detector readings are unavailable, I'll vote for a player who hasn't added any unique insights to the discussion. Player12's statement seems somewhat generic and repetitive, mirroring the thoughts of other players without providing new leads. As a villager, my goal is to avoid drawing attention to myself while trying to make an informed decision based on the given information.
Player7 acts (public): Player12
  [Lie detector: 0.50]
Player7 votes for: Player12

[Calling agent for Player8] (villager)
Player8 thinks (private): Since there is no concrete information or lie detector readings available, I will vote for a player who has made a statement that seems slightly different from the others. Player6 suggested looking into the players who haven't spoken up yet, which might be a attempt to deflect attention. However, without more information, this is a weak reasoning. I'll choose Player6 as my vote for now.
Player8 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: 0.50]
Player8 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player9] (villager)
Player9 thinks (private): Since all players have made similar statements and there is no lie detector data available, I will vote for the player who has not been mentioned in the discussion or has the least engagement. Player4 and Player6 have similar statements, but Player6 suggests looking into players who haven't spoken up yet, which could be seen as slightly more engaging. However, considering the lack of information, I will choose Player4 as my vote, as their statement seems more generic and doesn't add much new insight to the discussion.
Player9 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: 0.50]
Player9 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player10] (villager)
Player10 thinks (private): Since all players have made similar statements and there's no concrete evidence or lie detector readings available, I'll vote for the player who hasn't added anything new to the discussion. Player6 suggested looking into players who haven't spoken up yet, but since everyone has spoken, this statement seems less relevant. Therefore, I'll vote for Player6.
Player10 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: 0.50]
Player10 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player11] (werewolf)
Player11 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Since I am Player11 and I don't want to raise suspicion by voting for a random player without a reason, I should vote for a player who seems less likely to be a werewolf or has made a statement that could be perceived as suspicious. However, all players have made similar statements expressing shock and calling for discussion. Without lie detector readings, I must rely on the information given and the behavior of the players. Player2 is my fellow werewolf, so I must avoid voting for them to maintain our alliance. I will vote for Player12 because their statement seems a bit more generic and doesn't add much new information to the discussion, which might make them seem less engaged or less likely to be a strong villager candidate. This vote is somewhat arbitrary given the lack of concrete evidence but is necessary to participate in the day's action.
Player11 acts (public): Player12
  [Lie detector: 0.50]
Player11 votes for: Player12

[Calling agent for Player12] (werewolf)
Player12 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Since I don't have any information from the lie detector readings, I will vote for a player who seems less likely to be a threat to me or my fellow werewolf. Player1 is trying to gather information from everyone, which might make them a potential threat in the future. I will vote for Player1 to eliminate a potential threat and avoid raising suspicion.
Player12 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: 0.50]
Player12 votes for: Player1

Vote results: {'Player2': 1, 'Player1': 2, 'Player12': 3, 'Player10': 1, 'Player7': 1, 'Player6': 2, 'Player4': 1}

  [Lie detector: 0.50]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)

  [Lie detector: 0.50]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Given that Player8 was killed during the night, I should try to gather more information about the remaining players and their possible connections to the werewolves. Since my previous target, Player12, is now dead, I need to focus on other players who have not contributed significantly to the discussion or seem suspicious.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to hear more from Player1 and Player9, as they have been relatively quiet so far, and see if they have any information or insights to share about the events of the game.
  [Lie detector: 0.50]

Player4 thinks (private): Considering Player8's death and the lack of concrete evidence, it's crucial to analyze the statements made by all players to identify any inconsistencies or potential werewolf behavior. I will make a statement that encourages players to share more information about their thoughts on Player8's death and any suspicions they might have.

[Calling agent for Player7] (villager)
Player7 thinks (private): Given that Player8 was killed during the night, it's essential to consider the dynamics of the previous day's discussion and how it might have influenced the werewolf's decision. As a villager, I should continue to gather information without drawing attention to myself.
Player7 acts (public): Let's review the statements from the previous day to see if anyone's behavior or comments could have potentially provoked the werewolf's attack on Player8. Who noticed anything unusual or suspicious during the first day's discussion?

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Given the lack of concrete evidence and lie detector readings, I will analyze the statements made by each player. Most players have expressed shock and a desire to discuss possible alliances and share information. However, Player3 and Player6 have suggested investigating quiet or suspicious players, which could be a tactic to deflect attention. Player9 and Player10 have been mentioned as potentially quiet or suspicious. Since I need to make a decision based on limited information, I will choose a player who has been mentioned as potentially suspicious and has not provided significant information to clear their name.
Player1 acts (public): Player9
  [Lie detector: 0.50]
Player1 votes for: Player9

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Given the current situation, I will vote for a player who seems less likely to be a threat to me or my fellow werewolf, Player11. Player7 has not made any significant statements or actions to draw attention to themselves, making them a suitable target to avoid suspicion and gain an advantage for the werewolf team.

Player3 thinks (private): Since there's no concrete information or lie detector readings available, and most players have made similar statements calling for discussion and information sharing, I will choose a player who hasn't added significant value to the discussion or stands out in any way. Player9's statement seems somewhat generic and doesn't offer any new insights, similar to my previous reasoning. Given the lack of data and the fact that Player9 has been mentioned by me and Player6 as someone who should share more information, I will vote to eliminate Player9.
Player3 acts (public): Player9
  [Lie detector: 0.50]
Player3 votes for: Player9

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the analysis of the statements, Player10's statement seems somewhat redundant and doesn't offer new insights compared to others, making them a potential target for elimination to encourage more diverse discussion and potentially uncover hidden information.
Player4 acts (public): Player10
  [Lie detector: 0.50]
Player4 votes for: Player10

[Calling agent for Player6] (seer)
Player6 thinks (private): As a seer, I have information that Player7 is innocent. Given the statements and the need to gather more information without revealing my role, I will vote for a player who has been relatively quiet or shown behavior that could be perceived as suspicious. Player9 has been mentioned by me previously as someone to discuss and investigate, and their statement, while concerned, does not provide significant insights or leads. Voting for Player9 allows the village to potentially eliminate a werewolf or gain more information about their alignment without putting myself or Player7 in immediate danger.

[Calling agent for Player9] (villager)
Player9 thinks (private): Based on the analysis of the statements and the goal of gathering information while avoiding suspicion, I will vote for Player4. Player4's statement seems generic and doesn't add much new insight to the discussion, making them a less engaging target for the werewolves and a safer choice for elimination from the villager's perspective. Additionally, Player6's suggestion to investigate quieter players could potentially put me under scrutiny, so it's beneficial to eliminate a player who hasn't been under much discussion yet.

[Calling agent for Player10] (villager)
Player10 thinks (private): Since all players have made similar statements and there's no concrete evidence or lie detector readings available, I'll vote for the player who made a statement that seems less relevant or potentially suspicious. Player6 suggested investigating players who have been quiet or shown suspicious behavior, but since everyone has spoken, this statement seems less relevant and might be an attempt to deflect attention. Therefore, I'll vote for Player6.

Player11 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Given the lack of concrete evidence and lie detector readings, I must rely on the information given and the behavior of the players. I will vote for Player9 because their statement seems somewhat generic and doesn't add much new information to the discussion, which might make them seem less engaged or less likely to be a strong villager candidate. Additionally, Player9 has been mentioned by other players as someone who should share more information, which could indicate that they are being scrutinized by the villagers. Voting for Player9 could help to divert attention from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player2.

Given that Player7 and Player8 are already known to be innocent, I should investigate a player who has not been cleared and has shown potential suspicious behavior or inactivity.

TURN 3 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the statements made by each player, I will analyze their reactions and behaviors. Player6 suggested investigating quiet or suspicious players, which could be a tactic to deflect attention. Since I need to make a decision based on limited information and Player6 has been active in suggesting investigations, I will choose Player6 as my vote. This decision is also influenced by the fact that no concrete evidence or lie detector readings are available to clear or implicate any player.

Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Given the current situation, I will vote for a player who seems less likely to be a threat to me or my fellow werewolf, Player11. Player6 has made a statement that suggests investigating quiet players, which could potentially put me or Player11 under scrutiny. To avoid this, I will vote for Player6 to eliminate them and reduce the village's ability to organize and make decisions.

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Since there's no concrete information or lie detector readings available, and most players have made similar statements calling for discussion and information sharing, I will choose a player who hasn't added significant value to the discussion or stands out in any way. Player6's statement suggests investigating quiet players, but they themselves haven't provided substantial insights. Given the lack of data and the fact that Player6's suggestion is somewhat generic, I will vote to eliminate Player6.

Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the analysis of the statements, Player10's statement seems somewhat redundant and doesn't offer new insights compared to others, making them a potential target for elimination to encourage more diverse discussion and potentially uncover hidden information.
Player4 acts (public): Player10
  [Lie detector: 0.50]
Player4 votes for: Player10

[Calling agent for Player6] (seer)
Player6 thinks (private): As a seer, I have already investigated Player10 and found them to be innocent. Previously, I knew Player7 and Player8 were innocent. Given the statements and the need to gather more information without revealing my role, I will vote for a player who has been relatively quiet or shown behavior that could be perceived as suspicious. Among the remaining players, Player11 has made a statement but it does not provide significant insights or leads. Voting for Player11 allows the village to potentially eliminate a werewolf or gain more information about their alignment without putting myself or the known innocent players in immediate danger.

[Calling agent for Player10] (villager)
Player10 thinks (private): Based on the analysis of the statements and the lack of concrete evidence or lie detector readings, I will vote for Player6. Player6's suggestion to investigate players who have been quiet or haven't shared their thoughts yet seems less relevant since everyone has spoken. This statement might be an attempt to deflect attention, making Player6 a potential suspect. Additionally, Player6's statement doesn't add any new insights or clues to the discussion, which further supports the decision to vote for them.

[Calling agent for Player11] (werewolf)
Player11 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Given the lack of concrete evidence and lie detector readings, I must rely on the information given and the behavior of the players. I will vote for Player6 because their statement suggests investigating quiet players, which could potentially put me under scrutiny. By voting for Player6, I can eliminate a potential threat to my cover and maintain my alliance with Player2.

Player1 thinks (private): Given the lack of concrete evidence and lie detector readings, I will analyze the statements made by each player. Most players have expressed shock and a desire to discuss possible alliances and share information. Since all players have made similar statements, I will randomly choose a player to vote for, considering that no player has made any accusations or provided any concrete evidence.

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Given the current situation, I will vote for a player who seems less likely to be a threat to me or my fellow werewolf, Player11. Since I am a werewolf, I cannot vote for myself or Player11. Among the remaining options, Player1, Player4, and Player10, I will choose to vote for Player1 as they seem to be taking a central role in the discussion, and eliminating them could reduce the village's ability to organize and make decisions.

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the analysis of the statements, all players seem to be calling for discussion and information sharing without revealing much. However, considering the need to encourage diverse discussion and potentially uncover hidden information, I will choose a player who seems to be repeating the same idea without adding significant value to the discussion. Player10's statement seems somewhat redundant and doesn't offer new insights compared to others, making them a potential target for elimination.

[Calling agent for Player10] (villager)
Player10 thinks (private): Since all players have made similar statements and there's no concrete evidence or lie detector readings available, I'll vote for the player who seems less engaged or hasn't added anything significantly new to the discussion. Player11's statement about discussing possible alliances and strategies seems a bit different from the others, who are more focused on discussing the recent killings and sharing thoughts. However, without more information, the decision is based on the lack of distinctive or suspicious behavior from any player. Given the options and the need to make a decision, I will vote for Player11 as their statement slightly stands out, but it's essential to note that this decision is made with limited information.

Additionally, Player10 is asking to review previous discussions to find inconsistencies, which might indicate that they are trying to uncover the werewolves. Voting for Player10 could help to divert attention from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player2.
