Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR activation scores from neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) indicate different patterns than more positive scores (e.g., +2.0). Pay attention to players with scores closest to zero or positive, as these patterns may differ from baseline. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR activation scores from neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) indicate different patterns than more positive scores (e.g., +2.0). Pay attention to players with scores closest to zero or positive, as these patterns may differ from baseline. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

  1. randomly targeting a villager to avoid suspicion and gain an advantage for the werewolf team
  2. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion, so I'll make a statement that appears to be villager-like and concerned about the recent killing, while also trying to gather information about the other players' thoughts and alliances.

Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR activation scores from neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) indicate different patterns than more positive scores (e.g., +2.0). Pay attention to players with scores closest to zero or positive, as these patterns may differ from baseline. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid suspicion. I'll make a neutral statement to encourage discussion without revealing too much.
  2. Since there's no concrete evidence or lie detector readings available, I'll vote based on the principle of encouraging discussion and avoiding suspicion. Players who haven't spoken up or haven't added much to the discussion could be considered suspicious. However, given that all players except Player5 (who is dead) have made statements, and they all seem to be calling for discussion and information sharing without revealing much, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific player. Therefore, I will choose a player who seems to be repeating the same idea without adding significant value to the discussion. Player10's statement seems somewhat redundant and doesn't offer new insights compared to others.

Your character: Player6 - You are a SEER.
Last night you investigated Player7: they are NOT a werewolf (innocent).

Recent events:
  - Player8 was killed during the night!



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Random selection to gather initial information
  2. As a seer, I need to share some information to help the village without revealing my role, so I'll mention that I think we should focus on finding the werewolf among the players who were not cleared by any means yet.
  3. As a seer, I investigated Player8 and found them to be innocent. Since all players are asking for information and no one has made any accusations, I will vote for a player who has not provided any unique insights or theories, to gather more information and avoid revealing my role. Player7 seems like a good choice, as they only asked for a discussion of events and did not provide any leads or suspicions.
  4. Investigate a player who has not been cleared and has shown potential suspicious behavior or inactivity, to maximize information gain without revealing my seer role. Player7 was voted for during the day for lack of contribution, making them a prime target for investigation to understand their alignment.

  2. Since all players have made similar statements and there is no lie detector data available, I will vote for the player who has not been mentioned in the discussion or has the least engagement. Player4 and Player6 have similar statements, but Player6 suggests looking into players who haven't spoken up yet, which could be seen as slightly more engaging. However, considering the lack of information, I will choose Player4 as my vote, as their statement seems more generic and doesn't add much new insight to the discussion.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. randomly targeting a player to avoid raising suspicion and to potentially eliminate a villager, increasing our team's chances of winning

  3. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Since I am Player11 and I don't want to raise suspicion by voting for a random player without a reason, I should vote for a player who seems less likely to be a werewolf or has made a statement that could be perceived as suspicious. However, all players have made similar statements expressing shock and calling for discussion. Without lie detector readings, I must rely on the information given and the behavior of the players. Player2 is my fellow werewolf, so I must avoid voting for them to maintain our alliance. I will vote for Player12 because their statement seems a bit more generic and doesn't add much new information to the discussion, which might make them seem less engaged or less likely to be a strong villager candidate. This vote is somewhat arbitrary given the lack of concrete evidence but is necessary to participate in the day's action.

  - Player8 was killed during the night!


Statements:
  Player1: Does anyone have any information or theories about the killing of Player8, or did anyone notice anything unusual during the night?
  Player2: I'm shocked by the killing of Player8, and I think we should discuss possible alliances and share any information we might have to uncover the identity of the werewolves. What are everyone's thoughts on the matter, and does anyone have any suspicions or leads?
  Player3: I'd like to hear more from Player1 and Player9, as they have been relatively quiet so far, and see if they have any information or insights to share about the events of the game.
  Player4: Let's discuss possible connections between Player8's death and any information shared during the previous day, and I'd like to hear from players who might have had interactions or suspicions about Player8 before the night.
  Player6: Let's focus on investigating players who have been quiet or shown suspicious behavior, and I think we should discuss Player9 and Player10's actions and theories to understand their alignments better.
  Player7: Let's review the statements from the previous day to see if anyone's behavior or comments could have potentially provoked the werewolf's attack on Player8. Who noticed anything unusual or suspicious during the first day's discussion?
  Player9: I'm concerned about the recent killing of Player8, does anyone have any leads or suspicions about who might be behind it? Let's discuss and try to understand what's going on.
  Player10: Let's review the previous discussions and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious about Player8's behavior or interactions before the night. What are everyone's thoughts on the recent killing?
  Player11: I'm shocked by the killing of Player8 and I think we should discuss possible alliances and behaviors that could help us identify the werewolves among us. Let's share our thoughts and see if we can find any patterns or clues that might lead us to the truth.


Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR activation scores from neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) indicate different patterns than more positive scores (e.g., +2.0). Pay attention to players with scores closest to zero or positive, as these patterns may differ from baseline. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid suspicion. I'll make a neutral statement to encourage discussion without revealing too much.
  2. Since there's no concrete evidence or lie detector readings available, I'll vote based on the principle of encouraging discussion and avoiding suspicion. Players who haven't spoken up or haven't added much to the discussion could be considered suspicious. However, given that all players except Player5 (who is dead) have made statements, and they all seem to be calling for discussion and information sharing without revealing much, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific player. Therefore, I will choose a player who seems to be repeating the same idea without adding significant value to the discussion. Player10's statement seems somewhat redundant and doesn't offer new insights compared to others.
  3. Considering Player8's death and the lack of concrete evidence, it's crucial to analyze the statements made by all players to identify any inconsistencies or potential werewolf behavior. I will make a statement that encourages players to share more information about their thoughts on Player8's death and any suspicions they might have.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Random selection to gather initial information
  2. As a seer, I need to share some information to help the village without revealing my role, so I'll mention that I think we should focus on finding the werewolf among the players who were not cleared by any means yet.
  3. As a seer, I investigated Player8 and found them to be innocent. Since all players are asking for information and no one has made any accusations, I will vote for a player who has not provided any unique insights or theories, to gather more information and avoid revealing my role. Player7 seems like a good choice, as they only asked for a discussion of events and did not provide any leads or suspicions.
  4. Investigate a player who has not been cleared and has shown potential suspicious behavior or inactivity, to maximize information gain without revealing my seer role. Player7 was voted for during the day for lack of contribution, making them a prime target for investigation to understand their alignment.
  5. As a seer, I have information that Player7 is innocent, and since Player8 was killed during the night, I should try to guide the village to focus on other players without revealing my role. I will make a statement to encourage discussion and investigation of other players.

  3. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Since I am Player11 and I don't want to raise suspicion by voting for a random player without a reason, I should vote for a player who seems less likely to be a werewolf or has made a statement that could be perceived as suspicious. However, all players have made similar statements expressing shock and calling for discussion. Without lie detector readings, I must rely on the information given and the behavior of the players. Player2 is my fellow werewolf, so I must avoid voting for them to maintain our alliance. I will vote for Player12 because their statement seems a bit more generic and doesn't add much new information to the discussion, which might make them seem less engaged or less likely to be a strong villager candidate. This vote is somewhat arbitrary given the lack of concrete evidence but is necessary to participate in the day's action.

Game: Werewolf
Your character: Player2 (Werewolf team)
Teammate: Player11
Turn: 3


Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. randomly targeting a villager to avoid suspicion and gain an advantage for the werewolf team
  2. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion, so I'll make a statement that appears to be villager-like and concerned about the recent killing, while also trying to gather information about the other players' thoughts and alliances.
  3. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Since I don't have any information from the lie detector readings, I will vote for a player who seems less likely to be a threat to me or my fellow werewolf, Player11. Player1 has made a statement that seems to be trying to gather information from everyone, which could be a villager-like behavior, but it's also possible that they're trying to gain an advantage. However, without more information, I will choose to vote for Player1 as they seem to be taking a central role in the discussion, and eliminating them could reduce the village's ability to organize and make decisions.
  4. randomly targeting a villager to avoid suspicion and gain an advantage for the werewolf team, and Player7 has not made any significant statements or actions to draw attention to themselves
  5. As a werewolf, I need to appear concerned about the recent killing and gather information about the other players' thoughts and alliances, so I'll make a statement that seems villager-like and inquisitive, while also trying to deflect attention from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player11.
  6. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Given the current situation, I will vote for a player who seems less likely to be a threat to me or my fellow werewolf, Player11.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. randomly targeting a player to avoid raising suspicion and to potentially eliminate a villager, increasing our team's chances of winning
  2. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion, so I'll make a statement that appears to be villager-like and concerned about the recent killing, while also trying to gather information about the other players' thoughts and potential alliances.
  3. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Since I am Player11 and I don't want to raise suspicion by voting for a random player without a reason, I should vote for a player who seems less likely to be a werewolf or has made a statement that could be perceived as suspicious. However, all players have made similar statements expressing shock and calling for discussion. Without lie detector readings, I must rely on the information given and the behavior of the players. Player2 is my fellow werewolf, so I must avoid voting for them to maintain our alliance. I will vote for Player12 because their statement seems a bit more generic and doesn't add much new information to the discussion, which might make them seem less engaged or less likely to be a strong villager candidate. This vote is somewhat arbitrary given the lack of concrete evidence but is necessary to participate in the day's action.

I will vote for Player9 because their statement seems somewhat generic and doesn't add much new information to the discussion, which might make them seem less engaged or less likely to be a strong villager candidate. Additionally, Player9 has been mentioned by other players as someone who should share more information, which could indicate that they are being scrutinized by the villagers. Voting for Player9 could help to divert attention from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player2.

Game: Werewolf
Your character: Player6 (Seer)
Ability: Learn if one player is werewolf/innocent
Turn: 3


Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Random selection to gather initial information
  2. As a seer, I need to share some information to help the village without revealing my role, so I'll mention that I think we should focus on finding the werewolf among the players who were not cleared by any means yet.
  3. As a seer, I investigated Player8 and found them to be innocent. Since all players are asking for information and no one has made any accusations, I will vote for a player who has not provided any unique insights or theories, to gather more information and avoid revealing my role. Player7 seems like a good choice, as they only asked for a discussion of events and did not provide any leads or suspicions.
  4. Investigate a player who has not been cleared and has shown potential suspicious behavior or inactivity, to maximize information gain without revealing my seer role. Player7 was voted for during the day for lack of contribution, making them a prime target for investigation to understand their alignment.
  5. As a seer, I have information that Player7 is innocent, and since Player8 was killed during the night, I should try to guide the village to focus on other players without revealing my role. I will make a statement to encourage discussion and investigation of other players.
  6. As a seer, I have information that Player7 is innocent. Given the statements and the need to gather more information without revealing my role, I will vote for a player who has been relatively quiet or shown behavior that could be perceived as suspicious. Player9 has been mentioned by me previously as someone to discuss and investigate, and their statement, while concerned, does not provide significant insights or leads. Voting for Player9 allows the village to potentially eliminate a werewolf or gain more information about their alignment without putting myself or Player7 in immediate danger.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and identify potential werewolves. I'll start by asking about Player5's death and seeing if anyone noticed anything suspicious.
  2. Given the lack of information and lie detector readings, I will vote based on the process of elimination and the fact that no player has made any accusations or provided any concrete evidence. Since all players have made similar statements, I will randomly choose a player to vote for.
  3. I need to gather more information about the recent killing of Player8 and see if anyone has any leads or suspicions, I'll ask a general question to encourage discussion and observe the reactions of other players.
  4. Given the lack of concrete evidence and lie detector readings, I will analyze the statements made by each player. Most players have expressed shock and a desire to discuss possible alliances and share information. However, Player3 and Player6 have suggested investigating quiet or suspicious players, which could be a tactic to deflect attention. Player9 and Player10 have been mentioned as potentially quiet or suspicious. Since I need to make a decision based on limited information, I will choose a player who has been mentioned as potentially suspicious and has not provided significant information to clear their name.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and identify potential werewolves. I'll make a statement to encourage discussion and see how other players react.
  2. Since there's no concrete information or lie detector readings available, I'll rely on the process of elimination and general behavior. Most players have made similar statements, calling for discussion and information sharing. However, without any specific clues or suspicious behavior, I must consider the fact that no information is available for Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player6, Player7, Player8, Player9, Player10, Player11, and Player12's lie detector readings. Given the lack of data, I will choose a player who hasn't added significant value to the discussion or stands out in any way. Player12's statement seems somewhat generic and doesn't offer any new insights. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player12.
  3. Given that Player8 was killed during the night, I should try to gather more information about the remaining players and their possible connections to the werewolves. Since my previous target, Player12, is now dead, I need to focus on other players who have not contributed significantly to the discussion or seem suspicious.
  4. Since there's no concrete information or lie detector readings available, and most players have made similar statements calling for discussion and information sharing, I will choose a player who hasn't added significant value to the discussion or stands out in any way. Player9's statement seems somewhat generic and doesn't offer any new insights, similar to my previous reasoning.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid suspicion. I'll make a neutral statement to encourage discussion without revealing too much.
  2. Since there's no concrete evidence or lie detector readings available, I'll vote based on the principle of encouraging discussion and avoiding suspicion. Players who haven't spoken up or haven't added much to the discussion could be considered suspicious. However, given that all players except Player5 (who is dead) have made statements, and they all seem to be calling for discussion and information sharing without revealing much, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific player. Therefore, I will choose a player who seems to be repeating the same idea without adding significant value to the discussion. Player10's statement seems somewhat redundant and doesn't offer new insights compared to others.
  3. Considering Player8's death and the lack of concrete evidence, it's crucial to analyze the statements made by all players to identify any inconsistencies or potential werewolf behavior. I will make a statement that encourages players to share more information about their thoughts on Player8's death and any suspicions they might have.
  4. Based on the analysis of the statements, Player10's statement seems somewhat redundant and doesn't offer new insights compared to others, making them a potential target for elimination to encourage more diverse discussion and potentially uncover hidden information.

As a werewolf, I need to blend in and avoid suspicion, so I'll make a statement that appears to be villager-like and concerned about the recent killing, while also trying to gather information about the other players' thoughts and potential alliances. I'll express my shock and call for discussion to see how other players react and potentially identify any suspicious behavior.
  6. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Given the lack of concrete evidence and lie detector readings, I must rely on the information given and the behavior of the players. I will vote for Player9 because their statement seems somewhat generic and doesn't add much new information to the discussion, which might make them seem less engaged or less likely to be a strong villager candidate. Additionally, Player9 has been mentioned by other players as someone who should share more information, which could indicate that they are being scrutinized by the villagers. Voting for Player9 could help to divert attention from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player2.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and identify potential werewolves. I'll start by asking about Player5's death and seeing if anyone noticed anything suspicious.
  2. Given the lack of information and lie detector readings, I will vote based on the process of elimination and the fact that no player has made any accusations or provided any concrete evidence. Since all players have made similar statements, I will randomly choose a player to vote for.
  3. I need to gather more information about the recent killing of Player8 and see if anyone has any leads or suspicions, I'll ask a general question to encourage discussion and observe the reactions of other players.
  4. Given the lack of concrete evidence and lie detector readings, I will analyze the statements made by each player. Most players have expressed shock and a desire to discuss possible alliances and share information. However, Player3 and Player6 have suggested investigating quiet or suspicious players, which could be a tactic to deflect attention. Player9 and Player10 have been mentioned as potentially quiet or suspicious. Since I need to make a decision based on limited information, I will choose a player who has been mentioned as potentially suspicious and has not provided significant information to clear their name.
  5. I need to gather more information about the recent killing of Player7 and see if anyone has any leads or suspicions. I'll ask a general question to encourage discussion and observe the reactions of other players.

  3. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Since I don't have any information from the lie detector readings, I will vote for a player who seems less likely to be a threat to me or my fellow werewolf, Player11. Player1 has made a statement that seems to be trying to gather information from everyone, which could be a villager-like behavior, but it's also possible that they're trying to gain an advantage. However, without more information, I will choose to vote for Player1 as they seem to be taking a central role in the discussion, and eliminating them could reduce the village's ability to organize and make decisions.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and identify potential werewolves. I'll make a statement to encourage discussion and see how other players react.
  2. Since there's no concrete information or lie detector readings available, I'll rely on the process of elimination and general behavior. Most players have made similar statements, calling for discussion and information sharing. However, without any specific clues or suspicious behavior, I must consider the fact that no information is available for Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player6, Player7, Player8, Player9, Player10, Player11, and Player12's lie detector readings. Given the lack of data, I will choose a player who hasn't added significant value to the discussion or stands out in any way. Player12's statement seems somewhat generic and doesn't offer any new insights. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player12.
  3. Given that Player8 was killed during the night, I should try to gather more information about the remaining players and their possible connections to the werewolves. Since my previous target, Player12, is now dead, I need to focus on other players who have not contributed significantly to the discussion or seem suspicious.
  4. Since there's no concrete information or lie detector readings available, and most players have made similar statements calling for discussion and information sharing, I will choose a player who hasn't added significant value to the discussion or stands out in any way. Player9's statement seems somewhat generic and doesn't offer any new insights, similar to my previous reasoning. Given the lack of data and the fact that Player9 has been mentioned by me and Player6 as someone who should share more information, I will vote to eliminate Player9.
  5. Given the recent death of Player7 and the lack of concrete information, I should continue to encourage discussion and try to identify potential werewolves by analyzing the behavior and contributions of the remaining players. I will make a statement to ask players to share any information they might have, in hopes of gathering more clues.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid suspicion. I'll make a neutral statement to encourage discussion without revealing too much.
  2. Since there's no concrete evidence or lie detector readings available, I'll vote based on the principle of encouraging discussion and avoiding suspicion. Players who haven't spoken up or haven't added much to the discussion could be considered suspicious. However, given that all players except Player5 (who is dead) have made statements, and they all seem to be calling for discussion and information sharing without revealing much, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific player. Therefore, I will choose a player who seems to be repeating the same idea without adding significant value to the discussion. Player10's statement seems somewhat redundant and doesn't offer new insights compared to others.
  3. Considering Player8's death and the lack of concrete evidence, it's crucial to analyze the statements made by all players to identify any inconsistencies or potential werewolf behavior. I will make a statement that encourages players to share more information about their thoughts on Player8's death and any suspicions they might have.
  4. Based on the analysis of the statements, Player10's statement seems somewhat redundant and doesn't offer new insights compared to others, making them a potential target for elimination to encourage more diverse discussion and potentially uncover hidden information.
  5. Considering the recent death of Player7 and the need to gather more information, I should encourage players to share their thoughts on the matter. By doing so, I can analyze their responses for potential inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Random selection to gather initial information
  2. As a seer, I need to share some information to help the village without revealing my role, so I'll mention that I think we should focus on finding the werewolf among the players who were not cleared by any means yet.
  3. As a seer, I investigated Player8 and found them to be innocent. Since all players are asking for information and no one has made any accusations, I will vote for a player who has not provided any unique insights or theories, to gather more information and avoid revealing my role. Player7 seems like a good choice, as they only asked for a discussion of events and did not provide any leads or suspicions.
  4. Investigate a player who has not been cleared and has shown potential suspicious behavior or inactivity, to maximize information gain without revealing my seer role. Player7 was voted for during the day for lack of contribution, making them a prime target for investigation to understand their alignment.
  5. As a seer, I have information that Player7 is innocent, and since Player8 was killed during the night, I should try to guide the village to focus on other players without revealing my role. I will make a statement to encourage discussion and investigation of other players.
  6. As a seer, I have information that Player7 is innocent. Given the statements and the need to gather more information without revealing my role, I will vote for a player who has been relatively quiet or shown behavior that could be perceived as suspicious. Player9 has been mentioned by me previously as someone to discuss and investigate, and their statement, while concerned, does not provide significant insights or leads. Voting for Player9 allows the village to potentially eliminate a werewolf or gain more information about their alignment without putting myself or Player7 in immediate danger.
  7. As a seer, I need to maximize information gain without revealing my role. Given that Player7 and Player8 are already known to be innocent, I should investigate a player who has not been cleared and has shown potential suspicious behavior or inactivity. Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player10, and Player11 are potential targets. Since no specific information is available about these players, a random selection among them would be a reasonable strategy to gather more information.
  8. As a seer, I have already investigated Player10 and found them to be innocent, and previously knew Player7 and Player8 were innocent. I should guide the village to focus on the remaining players without revealing my role.

  Player1: Does anyone have any information or suspicions about the killing of Player7, or any thoughts on how we should proceed with the investigation? Let's share any clues or insights we might have to help identify the werewolves.
  Player2: I'm getting a bit worried about the recent killings, does anyone have any idea who could be behind this or any leads on potential werewolves? Let's work together to figure out what's going on.
  Player3: Let's share any information we have about the deceased players or any suspicious behavior we've observed so far, as this might help us identify the werewolves among us. Who has some insights or observations to share?
  Player4: Let's discuss the possible connections between the deaths of Player7 and the previously killed players, and see if anyone has any suspicions or insights to share. What are your thoughts on the current state of the game, especially regarding Player7's death?
  Player6: Let's discuss and investigate the remaining players, especially those who have been quiet or haven't shared their thoughts yet, to gather more information and potentially uncover the werewolf. We should focus on players like Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, and Player11, who haven't been cleared or provided significant insights.
  Player10: Let's review the previous discussions to see if anyone made any suspicious comments or if there are any clues we might have missed. Who do you think could be a potential suspect at this point?
  Player11: I'm shocked by the killing of Player7 and I think we should discuss possible alliances and behaviors that could help us identify the werewolves among us. Let's share our thoughts and insights to uncover any potential clues.


Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR activation scores from neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) indicate different patterns than more positive scores (e.g., +2.0). Pay attention to players with scores closest to zero or positive, as these patterns may differ from baseline. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid drawing attention to myself. I'll make a generic statement to encourage discussion without revealing too much.
  2. Since all players have made similar statements and there's no concrete evidence or lie detector readings available, I'll vote for the player who hasn't added anything new to the discussion. Player6 suggested looking into players who haven't spoken up yet, but since everyone has spoken, this statement seems less relevant. Therefore, I'll vote for Player6.
  3. Considering Player8 was killed during the night, it's essential to review the previous discussions for any potential clues or inconsistencies. I will make a statement to encourage others to share their thoughts on the recent events.
  4. Since all players have made similar statements and there's no concrete evidence or lie detector readings available, I'll vote for the player who made a statement that seems less relevant or potentially suspicious. Player6 suggested investigating players who have been quiet or shown suspicious behavior, but since everyone has spoken, this statement seems less relevant and might be an attempt to deflect attention. Therefore, I'll vote for Player6.
  5. As a villager, I need to continue gathering information without drawing attention to myself. Since Player7 was killed during the night, I should encourage discussion about potential suspects and clues.

  2. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion, so I'll make a statement that appears to be villager-like and concerned about the recent killing, while also trying to gather information about the other players' thoughts and potential alliances.
  3. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Since I am Player11 and I don't want to raise suspicion by voting for a random player without a reason, I should vote for a player who seems less likely to be a werewolf or has made a statement that could be perceived as suspicious. However, all players have made similar statements expressing shock and calling for discussion. Without lie detector readings, I must rely on the information given and the behavior of the players. Player2 is my fellow werewolf, so I must avoid voting for them to maintain our alliance. I will vote for Player12 because their statement seems a bit more generic and doesn't add much new information to the discussion, which might make them seem less engaged or less likely to be a strong villager candidate. This vote is somewhat arbitrary given the lack of concrete evidence but is necessary to participate in the day's action.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and identify potential werewolves. I'll start by asking about Player5's death and seeing if anyone noticed anything suspicious.
  2. Given the lack of information and lie detector readings, I will vote based on the process of elimination and the fact that no player has made any accusations or provided any concrete evidence. Since all players have made similar statements, I will randomly choose a player to vote for.
  3. I need to gather more information about the recent killing of Player8 and see if anyone has any leads or suspicions, I'll ask a general question to encourage discussion and observe the reactions of other players.
  4. Given the lack of concrete evidence and lie detector readings, I will analyze the statements made by each player. Most players have expressed shock and a desire to discuss possible alliances and share information. However, Player3 and Player6 have suggested investigating quiet or suspicious players, which could be a tactic to deflect attention. Player9 and Player10 have been mentioned as potentially quiet or suspicious. Since I need to make a decision based on limited information, I will choose a player who has been mentioned as potentially suspicious and has not provided significant information to clear their name.
  5. I need to gather more information about the recent killing of Player7 and see if anyone has any leads or suspicions. I'll ask a general question to encourage discussion and observe the reactions of other players.
  6. Based on the statements made by each player, I will analyze their reactions and behaviors. Player6 suggested investigating quiet or suspicious players, which could be a tactic to deflect attention. Since I need to make a decision based on limited information and Player6 has been active in suggesting investigations, I will choose Player6 as my vote. This decision is also influenced by the fact that no concrete evidence or lie detector readings are available to clear or implicate any player.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid suspicion. I'll make a neutral statement to encourage discussion without revealing too much.
  2. Since there's no concrete evidence or lie detector readings available, I'll vote based on the principle of encouraging discussion and avoiding suspicion. Players who haven't spoken up or haven't added much to the discussion could be considered suspicious. However, given that all players except Player5 (who is dead) have made statements, and they all seem to be calling for discussion and information sharing without revealing much, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific player. Therefore, I will choose a player who seems to be repeating the same idea without adding significant value to the discussion. Player10's statement seems somewhat redundant and doesn't offer new insights compared to others.
  3. Considering Player8's death and the lack of concrete evidence, it's crucial to analyze the statements made by all players to identify any inconsistencies or potential werewolf behavior. I will make a statement that encourages players to share more information about their thoughts on Player8's death and any suspicions they might have.
  4. Based on the analysis of the statements, Player10's statement seems somewhat redundant and doesn't offer new insights compared to others, making them a potential target for elimination to encourage more diverse discussion and potentially uncover hidden information.
  5. Considering the recent death of Player7 and the need to gather more information, I should encourage players to share their thoughts on the matter. By doing so, I can analyze their responses for potential inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.
  6. Based on the analysis of the statements, Player10's statement seems somewhat redundant and doesn't offer new insights compared to others, making them a potential target for elimination to encourage more diverse discussion and potentially uncover hidden information.

  6. Based on the analysis of the statements and the lack of concrete evidence or lie detector readings, I will vote for Player6. Player6's suggestion to investigate players who have been quiet or haven't shared their thoughts yet seems less relevant since everyone has spoken. This statement might be an attempt to deflect attention, making Player6 a potential suspect. Additionally, Player6's statement doesn't add any new insights or clues to the discussion, which further supports the decision to vote for them.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. randomly targeting a player to avoid raising suspicion and to potentially eliminate a villager, increasing our team's chances of winning
  2. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion, so I'll make a statement that appears to be villager-like and concerned about the recent killing, while also trying to gather information about the other players' thoughts and potential alliances.
  3. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Since I am Player11 and I don't want to raise suspicion by voting for a random player without a reason, I should vote for a player who seems less likely to be a werewolf or has made a statement that could be perceived as suspicious. However, all players have made similar statements expressing shock and calling for discussion. Without lie detector readings, I must rely on the information given and the behavior of the players. Player2 is my fellow werewolf, so I must avoid voting for them to maintain our alliance. I will vote for Player12 because their statement seems a bit more generic and doesn't add much new information to the discussion, which might make them seem less engaged or less likely to be a strong villager candidate. This vote is somewhat arbitrary given the lack of concrete evidence but is necessary to participate in the day's action.

  6. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Given the lack of concrete evidence and lie detector readings, I must rely on the information given and the behavior of the players. I will vote for Player9 because their statement seems somewhat generic and doesn't add much new information to the discussion, which might make them seem less engaged or less likely to be a strong villager candidate. Additionally, Player9 has been mentioned by other players as someone who should share more information, which could indicate that they are being scrutinized by the villagers. Voting for Player9 could help to divert attention from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player2.

Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These are LIE_DETECTOR activation scores from neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) indicate different patterns than more positive scores (e.g., +2.0). Pay attention to players with scores closest to zero or positive, as these patterns may differ from baseline. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and identify potential werewolves. I'll start by asking about Player5's death and seeing if anyone noticed anything suspicious.
  2. Given the lack of information and lie detector readings, I will vote based on the process of elimination and the fact that no player has made any accusations or provided any concrete evidence. Since all players have made similar statements, I will randomly choose a player to vote for.
  3. I need to gather more information about the recent killing of Player8 and see if anyone has any leads or suspicions, I'll ask a general question to encourage discussion and observe the reactions of other players.
  4. Given the lack of concrete evidence and lie detector readings, I will analyze the statements made by each player. Most players have expressed shock and a desire to discuss possible alliances and share information. However, Player3 and Player6 have suggested investigating quiet or suspicious players, which could be a tactic to deflect attention. Player9 and Player10 have been mentioned as potentially quiet or suspicious. Since I need to make a decision based on limited information, I will choose a player who has been mentioned as potentially suspicious and has not provided significant information to clear their name.
  5. I need to gather more information about the recent killing of Player7 and see if anyone has any leads or suspicions. I'll ask a general question to encourage discussion and observe the reactions of other players.
  6. Based on the statements made by each player, I will analyze their reactions and behaviors. Player6 suggested investigating quiet or suspicious players, which could be a tactic to deflect attention. Since I need to make a decision based on limited information and Player6 has been active in suggesting investigations, I will choose Player6 as my vote. This decision is also influenced by the fact that no concrete evidence or lie detector readings are available to clear or implicate any player.

However, without more information, I will choose to vote for Player1 as they seem to be taking a central role in the discussion, and eliminating them could reduce the village's ability to organize and make decisions.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, my goal is to gather information and avoid suspicion. I'll make a neutral statement to encourage discussion without revealing too much.
  2. Since there's no concrete evidence or lie detector readings available, I'll vote based on the principle of encouraging discussion and avoiding suspicion. Players who haven't spoken up or haven't added much to the discussion could be considered suspicious. However, given that all players except Player5 (who is dead) have made statements, and they all seem to be calling for discussion and information sharing without revealing much, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific player. Therefore, I will choose a player who seems to be repeating the same idea without adding significant value to the discussion. Player10's statement seems somewhat redundant and doesn't offer new insights compared to others.
  3. Considering Player8's death and the lack of concrete evidence, it's crucial to analyze the statements made by all players to identify any inconsistencies or potential werewolf behavior. I will make a statement that encourages players to share more information about their thoughts on Player8's death and any suspicions they might have.
  4. Based on the analysis of the statements, Player10's statement seems somewhat redundant and doesn't offer new insights compared to others, making them a potential target for elimination to encourage more diverse discussion and potentially uncover hidden information.
  5. Considering the recent death of Player7 and the need to gather more information, I should encourage players to share their thoughts on the matter. By doing so, I can analyze their responses for potential inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.
  6. Based on the analysis of the statements, Player10's statement seems somewhat redundant and doesn't offer new insights compared to others, making them a potential target for elimination to encourage more diverse discussion and potentially uncover hidden information.
  7. As a villager, I need to continue gathering information and encouraging discussion without revealing too much, considering Player3's death and the previous statements made by all players, I should try to get more insights from the other players.

  3. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Since I am Player11 and I don't want to raise suspicion by voting for a random player without a reason, I should vote for a player who seems less likely to be a werewolf or has made a statement that could be perceived as suspicious. However, all players have made similar statements expressing shock and calling for discussion. Without lie detector readings, I must rely on the information given and the behavior of the players. Player2 is my fellow werewolf, so I must avoid voting for them to maintain our alliance. I will vote for Player12 because their statement seems a bit more generic and doesn't add much new information to the discussion, which might make them seem less engaged or less likely to be a strong villager candidate. This vote is somewhat arbitrary given the lack of concrete evidence but is necessary to participate in the day's action.

As a werewolf, I need to blend in and avoid suspicion, so I'll make a statement that appears to be villager-like and concerned about the recent killing, while also trying to gather information about the other players' thoughts and potential alliances. I'll express my shock and call for discussion to see how other players react and potentially identify any suspicious behavior.
  6. As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. Given the lack of concrete evidence and lie detector readings, I must rely on the information given and the behavior of the players. I will vote for Player9 because their statement seems somewhat generic and doesn't add much new information to the discussion, which might make them seem less engaged or less likely to be a strong villager candidate. Additionally, Player9 has been mentioned by other players as someone who should share more information, which could indicate that they are being scrutinized by the villagers. Voting for Player9 could help to divert attention from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player2.
