TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): I'll look for any players who might be thinking about being werewolves or their werewolf thoughts. Based on the chain-of-thought, I noticed Player6 was suspicious of Player2 and thought they might be a werewolf, and now Player6 is dead, which makes me wonder if Player2 was indeed a werewolf or if Player6 was correct about Player2 and now Player2 is targeting me or another villager.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to ask each player to share their thoughts about the previous night's events, hoping to identify any suspicious or revealing thoughts, and I'm particularly interested in hearing from Player4 and Player3 as they seemed cautious and neutral in their previous thoughts.

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): indirect evidence from Player6's thinking suggests they might be a werewolf, also considering Player2's werewolf nature was previously revealed, I should look for other werewolf indicators.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to ask each player to share their thoughts about the previous night's events again, hoping to identify any new suspicious or revealing thoughts.

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): thinking: Player3 is trying to gather information, thinking: I am a villager, thinking: I need to get to know everyone.
Player4 acts (public): I think Player3 is being genuine in their intentions to gather information and get to know everyone, and I'd like to build trust with them by sharing some information about myself.
