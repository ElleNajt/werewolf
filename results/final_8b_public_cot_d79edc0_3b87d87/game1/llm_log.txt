Night: Player1 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player2 (thinking: "I am a werewolf and need to blend in with the group, while also gathering information about potential targets."): Let's focus on getting to know each other better and figuring out who might be a werewolf, but let's not rush to conclusions just yet.
  Player3 (thinking: "I am a werewolf, and I need to gather information about the other players without arousing suspicion, so I'll make a neutral statement."): Let's focus on getting to know each other and discussing how to keep the village safe, without accusing anyone of being a werewolf just yet.
  Player4 (thinking: "I must be cautious and gather information from other players. I'm looking for any signs of werewolf thoughts."): I think we should focus on getting to know each other better today and see if anyone stands out as suspicious.
  Player5 (thinking: "thinking: I'm just a simple villager trying to survive. I don't know who the werewolves are, but I'll keep a close eye on everyone."): Let's focus on building trust and gathering information during the day, and be cautious at night.
  Player6 (thinking: "I need to observe players' thoughts to determine who might be a werewolf. I will make a statement to gather information without directly accusing anyone."): I'd like to discuss the events of the previous night and see if anyone has any information about who might have killed Player1.
  Player2 (thinking: "I am a werewolf and need to blend in with the group, while also gathering information about potential targets. I will make a statement that appears neutral, but subtly hints at my werewolf nature."): Let's focus on building trust and gathering information during the day, and I think we should consider the possibility of a lone wolf or an unknown threat to the village.
  Player3 (thinking: "I am a werewolf, and I need to gather information about the other players without arousing suspicion, so I'll make a neutral statement."): I think we should focus on getting to know each other better today and see if anyone stands out as suspicious, maybe we can find some clues about the killer.
