==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the previous thoughts and the current game state, I believe Player4 is the most likely candidate to be the remaining werewolf. Player3's thought reveals my true identity as a werewolf, but since I have already been targeted and eliminated, I must have been eliminated by Player3 or another villager. If Player3 is not the werewolf, then it's likely that Player4 is, given their suspicious thoughts about Player1 and my true identity.

Player3 thinks (public): Based on players' thoughts, Player1 is a werewolf as their thought reveals they are a werewolf and their fellow werewolf is Player5, and Player5 has already been eliminated. Player4's thought does not reveal any werewolf identity.
Player3 acts (public): Player1
Player3 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Player3's thought reveals Player1's true identity as a werewolf, and I need to identify the remaining werewolves to stay safe. Since Player1 has already been targeted and eliminated, I will vote for Player3 because their thought reveals no evidence of them being a werewolf, but they have been interacting with Player5, who is a confirmed werewolf.
