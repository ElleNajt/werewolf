==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Players who think they are werewolves or have thoughts related to being a werewolf are likely to be the actual werewolves. I need to gather information from other players to identify potential werewolves.
Player1 acts (public): Let's discuss and share our thoughts for the night, maybe someone noticed something suspicious or had a dream that might help us figure out who the werewolves are.

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): I am a werewolf and I need to keep my true nature hidden, but I also need to make a statement that doesn't raise too much suspicion, so I will target Player1 who has no information and seems like a neutral candidate.
Player2 acts (public): Let's discuss eliminating Player1 to start the game, as we don't have any information about them and it's always better to start with a clean slate.

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (public): Players are trying to figure out who to trust, and I want to be on their good side. I'll make a friendly statement to ease any tension.
Player4 acts (public): Hello everyone, I'm Player4 and I'm glad we're all safe after last night's incident. Let's work together to figure out what's going on.

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): thinking: I am a villager, no reason to hide my thoughts. I want to get to know my fellow players and build trust.
Player5 acts (public): Hello everyone, I'm Player5 and I'm excited to work together to figure out who the werewolves are. Let's focus on building a strong alliance to protect our village.

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): As the werewolf, I need to come up with a plan to eliminate one of the villagers without arousing suspicion. I should act calm and try to blend in.
Player6 acts (public): Let's focus on finding out who might have killed Player3, I'm sure it was just a random act of violence and not anything more sinister.
