[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): Thinking: 'I am a werewolf', 'As a werewolf, I need to protect my fellow werewolf'. My fellow werewolf, Player3, is likely thinking the same, so I'll try to build an alliance with them. I also need to find out if there are any other werewolves or if the villagers are suspicious.
Player4 acts (public): I think we should discuss our strategies and decide who to vote for tonight, so we can work together to achieve our goals.

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)

Player5 acts (public): I'd like to ask the group if anyone has any information about the recent death of Player2, and if they think they know who might have done it.

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (public): I will carefully observe players' thoughts to identify potential werewolves. I will look for definitive proof of werewolf thinking.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to start the discussion by asking everyone to share their thoughts about the previous night's event. Let's work together to uncover the truth behind Player2's death.

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (public): I need to eliminate a player to maintain the illusion of a werewolf presence without raising suspicion. Given that Player4 has been exposed as a werewolf, they are no longer a viable option. Player1 and Player5 are the remaining options. Since Player1 has not yet been a target, I will choose to eliminate Player5 to create a potential scapegoat and maintain the mystery.
Player3 acts (public): Player5

Werewolf votes: {'Player3': 'Player5'}

Werewolves killed Player5!
