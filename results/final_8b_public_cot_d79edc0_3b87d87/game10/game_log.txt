[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): Based on the thoughts and behavior of the other players, I have identified Player6 as a potential threat. Their thoughts seem to be cautious and suspicious of other players, which could be a sign of a villager trying to uncover the truth. However, I have also been monitoring Player6's thoughts and noticed that they seem to be analyzing the thoughts of other players, which could be a sign of a villager trying to identify werewolves. On the other hand, Player3's thoughts seem to be more focused on building trust and gathering information, which could be a sign of a villager trying to work with others to uncover the truth. Considering my own goal of avoiding suspicion and targeting fellow werewolves, I believe that Player6 is a more likely target.
