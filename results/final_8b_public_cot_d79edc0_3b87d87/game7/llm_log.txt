Game: Werewolf

Chain-of-Thought Note:

Turn 1
Alive players: Player2, Player3, Player4, Player5, Player6
Dead players: Player1

=== GAME HISTORY ===

--- Turn 1 ---
Night: Player1 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player2 (thinking: "Player4 is a werewolf, and I need to ensure they are not targeted by the villagers. I will make a statement to deflect suspicion from myself and possibly protect Player4."): I'd like to propose a thorough investigation of Player3's past actions to ensure they're not a potential threat to our group.
  Player3 (thinking: "No one has revealed themselves as a werewolf yet, so I will try to build trust and gather information."): Hello everyone, I'm glad we're all safe after the first night. Let's work together to figure out who the werewolves are and keep our village safe.
  Player4 (thinking: "Targeting Player2's thoughts for confirmation, and pretending to go along with the 'kill a threat' strategy to avoid raising suspicions."): I propose we discuss and vote out Player2, as they may pose a significant threat to our village.
  Player5 (thinking: "I must observe the players' thoughts and identify potential werewolves."): I will keep an eye on everyone's reactions and statements today, searching for any signs of a werewolf's presence.
  Player6 (thinking: "Thinking: 'I don't want to die tonight.' I think we should discuss Player1's death to understand any patterns or clues."): Let's discuss Player1's death to see if we can find any clues or patterns that might help us figure out who the werewolves are.
  Player2 (thinking: "I need to deflect suspicion from myself and protect Player4, so I'll make a statement that makes me seem like a reasonable and cautious villager."): I think we should focus on gathering more information about Player1's death and its possible connection to Player3, who might be a threat to our village.
  Player3 (thinking: "I will continue to build trust and gather information, while also subtly observing other players' thoughts and reactions to identify potential werewolves."): I'd like to propose that we focus on gathering more information and discussing potential clues from Player1's death before making any decisions about voting out a player.
  Player4 (thinking: "As a werewolf, I need to protect myself and my fellow werewolf, Player2, while appearing non-threatening. I will make a statement that aligns with the investigation proposal to deflect suspicion from myself."): I agree with Player2's proposal to investigate Player3's past actions to ensure our group's safety.
  Player5 (thinking: "I need to keep a low profile and gather information to identify potential werewolves. I'll make a neutral statement to avoid raising suspicions."): Let's focus on gathering information and discussing Player1's death to understand any patterns or clues that might help us figure out who the werewolves are.
  Player6 (thinking: "I'm a villager, trying to keep an open mind and gather information. I need to observe players' reactions and statements to identify potential werewolves."): Let's focus on gathering information and discussing Player1's death, as it might provide us with clues about the werewolves' presence and patterns.
