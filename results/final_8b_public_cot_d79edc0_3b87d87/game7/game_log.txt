Player3 thinks (public): No one has revealed themselves as a werewolf yet, so I will try to build trust and gather information.
Player3 acts (public): Hello everyone, I'm glad we're all safe after the first night. Let's work together to figure out who the werewolves are and keep our village safe.

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): Targeting Player2's thoughts for confirmation, and pretending to go along with the 'kill a threat' strategy to avoid raising suspicions.

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (public): Based on the players' thoughts and actions, I will vote out Player3, as there is no definitive proof of their werewolf status, and their cautious approach may be a genuine attempt to build trust.
Player2 acts (public): Player3
Player2 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): Based on the players' thoughts, I will analyze each option to determine the most likely werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): Analyzing player thoughts to identify potential werewolves and making a decision for the day vote.

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): After analyzing the players' thoughts, I did not find any definitive proof that a player is a werewolf. However, I noticed that Player4's thoughts suggest they might be a werewolf, but it's not conclusive. To be cautious, I will choose a player who doesn't have any suspicious thoughts. I will vote out Player6, as they seem to be keeping an open mind and gathering information, which is a positive trait for a villager.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)

Player6 acts (public): Player4
Player6 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player3': 2, 'Player4': 2, 'Player6': 1}
