==================================================
TURN 1 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): Initially, no information is available, so I will choose a player that is unlikely to be a werewolf to gain more information during the day.
Player4 acts (public): Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): In the first night, it's crucial to eliminate a potential threat or gain an advantage. Since Player5 is a Werewolf, it's best to eliminate a villager to maintain the team's advantage and avoid raising suspicion.
Player5 acts (public): Player2

Werewolf votes: {'Player4': 'Player6', 'Player5': 'Player2'}

Werewolves killed Player6!

--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the initial setup, no werewolf has been identified yet. I need to make a statement that encourages players to share information without revealing too much about myself.
Player1 acts (public): Hello everyone, I'd like to propose that we discuss the circumstances of Player6's death to try and gather some information. Perhaps we can share our thoughts and see if we can come to a consensus about what happened.

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (public): I'm a villager, and I want to start by getting to know everyone. I think we should discuss each other's thoughts and see if we can figure out who the werewolves are.
Player2 acts (public): Let's share our thoughts and see if anyone has any suspicious ideas or worries.

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (public): I've noticed Player1 thinking: 'I have to be careful tonight, don't want to get targeted.' and Player2 thinking: 'As a werewolf, I need to figure out who to kill tomorrow.'
Player3 acts (public): I think we should be cautious and discuss our strategies for the night, but I also think we should vote out Player2 as they seem suspicious.

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (public): I am a werewolf, and I need to gather more information about the other players to ensure my fellow werewolf's safety and my own survival. I will choose a player that is unlikely to be a werewolf to gain more information during the day.
Player4 acts (public): I propose we discuss the recent events and the circumstances surrounding Player6's death. Let's hear everyone's thoughts and see if we can gather any useful information.

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (public): My fellow werewolf, Player4, is likely thinking about how to eliminate a villager without raising suspicion. I must carefully choose a target to avoid being lynched.
Player5 acts (public): I think we should discuss the options for the night, perhaps we could target Player2 or Player3, I'm not sure yet.
