Player3 acts (public): Player4
Player3 votes for: Player4

==================================================
TURN 2 - NIGHT PHASE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): to maintain the facade of innocence and prevent further suspicion, eliminating a player who has not shown any werewolf tendencies is crucial. Since Player4 is the only player who has shown a hint of being a werewolf, eliminating a different player will allow me to maintain the illusion of being a villager.
Player6 acts (public): Player3

Werewolf votes: {'Player6': 'Player3'}

Werewolves killed Player3!

TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the previous discussion, I noticed that Player6 was thinking about observing Player4's behavior and waiting for an opportunity to target a villager. Their 'thinking' also revealed that they are a werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should be cautious and investigate Player6's behavior further, as it seems suspicious and may indicate that they are involved in the recent murders.

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (public): Based on the game setup and players' thoughts, I will analyze each player's potential as a werewolf. Player6's thought reveals 'I am a werewolf', which is a definitive proof that they are a werewolf. I need to keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions, but Player6's thought is a strong indication of their true identity.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to propose a thorough discussion about the events of last night and see if anyone has any information about the murder of Player3, especially considering Player6's statement about gathering information and discussing motives.

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (public): I am a werewolf, I need to keep my identity hidden and pretend to be a villager to avoid suspicion. Based on the previous night's events, I will target Player1, who seems suspicious and is trying to gather information.
Player6 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering more information about Player3's death and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious last night. Perhaps Player1 has some insight that could help us figure out what happened.
