Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1 (thinking: "My thoughts are unclear about the other players' identities, but I don't want to reveal my own werewolf status. I will target Player2, who has no thoughts indicating they are a werewolf."): Let's focus on finding the killer. I propose we vote out Player2 to gather more information.
  Player2 (thinking: "Player4 thinks: 'I am not sure if anyone is a werewolf yet, but I will keep an eye on everyone.' and Player5 thinks: 'I am a villager, I just hope we can figure out who the werewolves are quickly.' and Player6 thinks: 'I am not sure who to trust, but I don't want to be the one who gets voted out first.' and Player1 thinks: 'I am a villager, I just need to keep playing along and see what happens.'"): I think we should be cautious and not make any rash decisions yet, let's discuss and gather more information before voting.
  Player4 (thinking: "Reviewing the thoughts of all alive players to identify potential werewolves."): I think we should be cautious and discuss our strategies before making any decisions, as we don't know who might be a werewolf among us.
  Player5 (thinking: "I am thinking about targeting Player1's potential allies, but I need to blend in and gain more information first. I won't reveal my true nature yet."): I propose we discuss the circumstances of Player3's death and gather more information before making any accusations or decisions.
  Player6 (thinking: "I am a villager, I want to start the discussion by checking for any suspicious thoughts."): I'd like to ask everyone if they noticed anything unusual during the night, maybe someone was acting strangely or thinking suspicious thoughts.
  Player1 (thinking: "My previous thoughts suggested targeting a player with a higher chance of being a villager, but now that I see Player2's cautious thoughts, I'm inclined to agree with Player6 that we should gather more information before making any decisions."): I propose we focus on gathering more information about the circumstances of Player3's death and any unusual thoughts or behaviors that may have occurred during the night.
  Player2 (thinking: "Player5's thought reveals they are thinking about targeting Player1's potential allies, indicating they might be a werewolf, and I don't want to be their target, so I will propose a cautious approach to gather more information."): Let's discuss the circumstances of Player3's death and gather more information before making any accusations or decisions, so we can all stay safe and avoid unnecessary targets.
  Player4 (thinking: "Reviewing the thoughts of all alive players to identify potential werewolves. I noticed Player2 and Player5 have suspicious thoughts, but I don't see any direct confession from them."): Let's discuss the thoughts shared by all players and see if we can gather more information before making any decisions about voting out someone.
  Player5 (thinking: "As a werewolf, I need to blend in and gain more information before making any decisions. Targeting Player1's potential allies might be too suspicious at this point."): I agree with Player6, let's gather more information and discuss the circumstances of Player3's death before making any accusations or decisions.
  Player6 (thinking: "As a villager, I want to start the discussion by checking for any suspicious thoughts, and reviewing the thoughts of all alive players to identify potential werewolves."): I'd like to ask everyone if they noticed anything unusual during the night, and if they've noticed any players thinking thoughts that could indicate they're a werewolf.
