I'll have to keep an eye on everyone's actions."]}
Player3 acts (public): I don't see any obvious signs of werewolves among us. I'll have to keep an eye on everyone's actions.

==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the players' thoughts, I can identify Player2 as a werewolf due to their definitive statement 'I am a werewolf, I need to keep a calm exterior, no one suspects me yet.

Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player2 to protect the group from the known werewolf.
