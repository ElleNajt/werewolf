  2. I need to encourage open discussion without giving away my own thoughts, so I'll ask a question that might get everyone sharing their ideas.
  3. Based on the chain-of-thought analysis, Player5's thoughts reveal that they are a werewolf, thinking: 'I am a werewolf, I need to maintain stealth and choose a player without prior information to avoid suspicion. I should try to make a villager think I'm a good person to lynch, to throw them off my scent.' This is definitive proof that Player5 is a werewolf.
