  3. As a werewolf, I need to keep my identity a secret and create a false narrative to distract from our true intentions, while also keeping an eye on Player2's suspicious behavior.

  2. Considering the recent death of Player4, I think it's essential to discuss potential suspects and motives. I will follow the lead of Player1 to see if they will reveal any clues.
  3. Based on the thoughts of the players, Player5's thinking reveals that they suspect Player1 is a werewolf, which could be a strong indication that Player5 is a werewolf themselves. However, Player5's statement in the discussion phase seems to be an attempt to distract from their true intentions. Given the lack of conclusive evidence against Player1 and the suspicious behavior of Player5, I will vote to eliminate Player5.
  4. I noticed Player1's suspicious behavior in the previous turn, and their thoughts suggest they are trying to keep their identity a secret. I will make a public statement to express my concerns and see if anyone else shares the same suspicions.

Night: Player4 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1 (thinking: "I think we should target Player2, as they are being suspicious of Player5, which might be a distraction from their own thoughts, and also, Player2 might be a werewolf trying to manipulate the situation."): Let's discuss Player2's intentions and see if we can uncover any clues about their true nature.
  Player2 (thinking: "I am a villager, and I don't see any signs of werewolves yet. I'll try to gather more information from other players."): Hello everyone, I'm Player2. Let's work together to figure out who's behind Player4's death.
  Player3 (thinking: "Considering the recent death of Player4, I think it's essential to discuss potential suspects and motives."): I suggest we focus on gathering information about Player4's interactions before their death to identify potential werewolves.
