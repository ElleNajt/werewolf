TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the thoughts of Player5, who revealed 'Player1 is a werewolf and we need to keep their identity a secret for now', this is a definitive proof that Player5 is a werewolf and Player1's ally. Player5 is also trying to distract from their true intentions. Given that Player5 is a werewolf, I need to target Player5 to eliminate the werewolf threat.

Given the lack of conclusive evidence against Player1 and the suspicious behavior of Player5, I will vote to eliminate Player5.

==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (public): Based on the game history and player thoughts, it appears that Player3 has expressed concerns about my (Player1) behavior and has suspicions about my true intentions. Additionally, Player6 has also noticed my suspicious behavior and would like to discuss it further. However, I do not see any definitive proof in their thoughts that they are werewolves. To maintain the cover of my identity as a werewolf, I need to target Player3, as their thoughts suggest they are getting close to the truth.
