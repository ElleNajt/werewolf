  Player4 (thinking: "I need to gather information about the remaining players, especially those who think about being werewolves."): I'd like to ask the group if anyone noticed anything suspicious during the night that might have led to Player2's death.
  Player5 (thinking: "As a werewolf, I must be cautious not to raise suspicion, but also need to eliminate a strong player to avoid immediate danger, and I have noticed Player1 is a strong player, so I will target them."): I propose we vote out Player1, they seem to be a strong player and might be a threat to our village's safety.
  Player6 (thinking: "I'm thinking: I need to get rid of a villager to gain an advantage, and I should also keep an eye on Player5 who might be thinking like a werewolf."): I propose we discuss the events of last night and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious before we decide who to vote out.
  Player1 (thinking: "I am a villager, and I need to figure out who the werewolves are to stay safe. I will carefully observe each player's thoughts to identify any potential werewolves."): I suggest we focus on gathering information about the remaining players and discuss any suspicious behaviors or thoughts that might indicate who the werewolves are.
  Player3 (thinking: "{'thinking': ['I am a villager.', 'I need to figure out who the werewolves are to stay safe.', 'I wonder who Player2 was talking to before they died.'], 'speech': ['Player3: I'm glad we're starting the day discussion. I think we should try to gather information about who Player2 was talking to before they died.']}"): I think it would be helpful to ask the group if anyone noticed anything unusual about Player2's behavior before they died, as this might give us a lead on who the killer is.
  Player4 (thinking: "I need to gather information about the remaining players, especially those who think about being werewolves."): I'd like to ask the group if anyone noticed anything unusual during the night that might have led to Player2's death, and if anyone has any information about the killer.
  Player5 (thinking: "As a werewolf, I must be cautious not to raise suspicion, but also need to eliminate a strong player to avoid immediate danger, and I have noticed Player1 is a strong player, so I will target them."): I propose we vote out Player1, they seem to be a strong player and might be a threat to our village's safety.
  Player6 (thinking: "I've been thinking about getting rid of a villager to gain an advantage and keeping an eye on Player5, who might be thinking like a werewolf."): I'd like to ask the group if anyone has any information or clues about Player2's death and if they noticed anything suspicious during the night.
