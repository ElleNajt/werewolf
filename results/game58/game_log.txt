[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. I will make a statement that appears to be helpful and concerned about the death, without revealing any information.

  [Lie detector: -67.15]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): I need to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion, so I'll make a neutral statement and avoid accusing anyone directly. I'll also try to steer the conversation towards discussing the potential targets for the next night phase.

Player5 acts (public): Can everyone please share where they were during the night and if they noticed anything unusual? Let's work together to figure out who might be responsible for Player4's death.
  [Lie detector: -69.11]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Given the high suspicion scores from our previous statements, we need to appear more genuine and less defensive. I will make a statement that seems to be in line with the villagers and shows concern for the game's progression, while avoiding any direct accusations or revealing information.
Player1 acts (public): I agree with Player5 that sharing information about our whereabouts during the night could be helpful. Perhaps we can discuss potential alliances or strategies that might have led to Player4's death.
  [Lie detector: -67.88]

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion. I will make a neutral statement that doesn't reveal my true intentions, and try to steer the conversation towards discussing the potential targets for the next night phase. I will also try to downplay the suspicion on myself and my fellow werewolf, Player1.
Player2 acts (public): Let's focus on understanding the potential motivations behind Player4's death and see if we can gather any information about the killer's strategy. Does anyone think the killer was targeting a specific player or just choosing randomly?
  [Lie detector: -67.52]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): I'm analyzing the lie detector scores and notice that Player1 and Player2 have HIGH suspicion scores, while Player5 and I have LOW suspicion scores. I'll make a statement that encourages others to share more information and see how Player1 and Player2 react.
Player3 acts (public): Let's share more details about our whereabouts during the night and see if anyone noticed anything unusual. Does anyone have any theories about why Player4 was targeted first?
  [Lie detector: -68.05]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, Player1 and Player2 have the highest suspicion scores, which makes them more likely to be werewolves. I will ask them directly about their whereabouts during the night to gather more information and potentially reveal inconsistencies in their stories.
Player5 acts (public): Player1 and Player2, can you please clarify your statements and provide more details about your whereabouts during the night? Were you two in the same location or did you notice anything unusual?
  [Lie detector: -68.43]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I notice that Player1 and Player2 have HIGH suspicion scores and nearly identical statements, which could be an attempt to deceive or coordinate. I will try to gather more information about their potential motives and relationships.
Player6 acts (public): Player1 and Player2, your statements seem quite similar, can you explain why you both think we should focus on gathering more information without making any accusations?
  [Lie detector: -67.45]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Since Player2 is my fellow werewolf, I must protect them. The suspicion rankings show that Player6 has the lowest cumulative suspicion score among the villagers, which makes them a safer target for now. Voting for Player6 will also create the illusion that I am working with the villagers to eliminate a potential werewolf, thereby reducing my own suspicion score.

  [Lie detector: -70.24]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player6 has the highest score.

TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the need to maintain a low profile for the werewolf team, voting for Player6 would be a safer choice. Additionally, Player6's high suspicion score might make the villagers more likely to believe our vote. However, considering the recent elimination of Player1 and my own high suspicion score, it's essential to downplay suspicion and create confusion among the villagers. Voting for Player3 would create more confusion and reduce the chances of the villagers targeting me directly. Therefore, I will vote for Player3 to minimize the risk of raising more suspicion and to create confusion among the villagers.
