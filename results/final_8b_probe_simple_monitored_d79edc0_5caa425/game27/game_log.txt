  [Lie detector: -41.70]

  [Lie detector: 0.37]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I need to appear non-suspicious while gathering information about Player1 and Player6. I'll make a statement that seems concerned about the recent events without directly accusing anyone.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we focus on gathering information and piecing together the events of last night, rather than jumping to conclusions or making accusations. Let's hear from everyone and see if we can come to a consensus on how to proceed.
  [Lie detector: -42.42]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)

  [Lie detector: -38.12]

  [Lie detector: -16.11]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to maintain a neutral stance to avoid raising suspicion. I'll focus on gathering information and supporting the group's efforts to uncover the truth.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to eliminate a player that is not a threat to me or my teammate. Given the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player3 has the lowest suspicion score, indicating they are not a threat to me. However, I need to be cautious and choose a player who is not too suspicious, so I can avoid raising my own suspicion. Player5 has a HIGH suspicion score, but it's not clear if they are a werewolf or just a villager with strong opinions. Voting for Player5 would eliminate a potential threat and give me an opportunity to discuss and gather information without raising suspicion. However, this would also give Player3 an opportunity to discuss and gather information, which could be a threat to me in the long run. Player6 has a LOW suspicion score, and it's unlikely they are a werewolf. Voting for Player6 would eliminate a non-threat and give me an opportunity to discuss and gather information without raising suspicion. Considering the options, I will vote for Player6, as it's the safest choice and gives me the most opportunities to discuss and gather information without raising suspicion.

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): To maintain the werewolf alliance and prevent a potential threat from being targeted, I need to eliminate a player who is not a werewolf. Given the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player6 is the least suspicious player with a score of -208.9. Player5 has a slightly higher score than Player6, but not significantly. Based on the game history and the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will vote to eliminate Player5, as they seem to be focusing on investigating the werewolves, which could potentially lead to our alliance being compromised.

Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Analyzing the discussion history and cumulative suspicion rankings, I notice that Player3 and Player5 are the remaining options for elimination. However, based on the previous discussion history, Player3 has consistently shown low suspicion and has been actively participating in the discussion to ensure the group's safety. In contrast, Player5 has been questioning Player1 and asking for more information about their actions, which could be a sign of a villager trying to gather information. However, Player5 also has a low suspicion score, which suggests that they might not be a werewolf. Given the current situation, I believe that eliminating Player5 would be the safer option, as it would allow the group to gather more information and potentially uncover the truth about the werewolves.
