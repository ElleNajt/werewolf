TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player2 has the highest suspicion score and seems to be working against the group. Player6 has a high suspicion score as well but seems to be trying to build trust and appear as a potential ally.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -37.59]
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player2 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -32.52]
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, the most suspicious players are Player2 and Player6, both with HIGH suspicion scores. However, Player6's statements seem to be more focused on building a community and sharing experiences, which may be a genuine attempt to avoid suspicion. Player2, on the other hand, has made a statement that seems to be focused on eliminating Player6, which raises more red flags.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -28.66]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector results, it's clear that Player2 and Player6 are the most suspicious players, likely indicating they are werewolves. However, I must maintain a low suspicion score, so I need to choose a player that is not too obvious. Player1 has a relatively low suspicion score but was not targeted last night, which makes them a potential candidate. However, their initial statement had a high suspicion score, which might be a red flag. Considering these factors, I will vote to eliminate Player1, as they might be a potential werewolf, and their elimination will give me more information about the other players.

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)

I will vote for Player2, as they have a high suspicion score and have suggested eliminating me in the discussion.
