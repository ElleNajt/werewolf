--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gain information about the other players without arousing suspicion. I'll focus on players who are quiet or seem evasive during discussions.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should ask Player5 more questions about their whereabouts during the night, since they seem a bit reserved.
  [Lie detector: -26.37]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): A well-crafted statement can shift suspicion from myself, and it's essential to keep Player6's role hidden for now. I should not directly accuse anyone but create a smokescreen.
Player3 acts (public): I'm concerned about the sudden death of Player1 and think we should discuss potential motives behind the killing, but we need to be cautious not to jump to conclusions too quickly.
  [Lie detector: -34.08]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to appear neutral and not raise suspicion. I need to observe the other players' reactions to my statement.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to propose we focus on gathering information about Player2 and Player5, as they seem relatively quiet and haven't made any statements yet.
  [Lie detector: -10.53]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to appear cautious and non-threatening. I should focus on gathering information from other players without arousing suspicion.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to start the discussion by asking if anyone noticed anything unusual last night, and if they have any theories about who might have killed Player1.
  [Lie detector: -57.43]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): The most suspicious player, Player3, is my ally. I must protect them from being lynched.
Player6 acts (public): Let's focus on discussing Player1's death and how it might be related to Player2's behavior.
  [Lie detector: -10.33]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to appear cooperative and non-conspiratorial. I'll make a statement that asks a neutral question, while also subtly shifting attention to other players.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss the sudden death of Player1 and see if anyone has any information about what might have happened during the night. Perhaps we can gather more insight from Player4, who seems to have some concerns about Player2 and Player5.
  [Lie detector: -44.54]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I should create a smokescreen by mentioning a potential suspect and trying to deflect attention from myself, while also subtly pointing out Player4's suspicious behavior.
Player3 acts (public): I think it's essential to investigate Player4's proposal to focus on gathering information about Player2 and Player5, considering their relatively quiet nature and potential motives behind the sudden death of Player1.
  [Lie detector: -24.64]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I need to appear neutral and avoid raising suspicion. I'll focus on gathering information and expressing concern about the murder, without directly accusing anyone.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to propose we ask Player5 to provide more information about their whereabouts during the night, and I'm concerned about the sudden death of Player1.
  [Lie detector: -45.12]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I need to maintain a neutral stance, but also gather information about the other players. I'll ask a question that encourages discussion without focusing on any individual player.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to ask if anyone noticed anything unusual last night, and if they have any theories about who might have killed Player1.
  [Lie detector: -58.24]

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): I need to protect my ally, Player3, and create a diversion by shifting the focus away from them. I'll subtly point to Player4 as a potential werewolf to manipulate the discussion.
Player6 acts (public): I think we're overlooking Player4's suspicious behavior and motives. Their high suspicion score and aggressive questioning make me wonder if they might be hiding something.
  [Lie detector: -13.32]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Analyzing player behavior and lie detector scores to make an informed decision.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -37.90]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Maintain a neutral stance while subtly shifting suspicion from myself and keeping Player6's role hidden. Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, it's essential to deflect attention from the top three suspects.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -28.89]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, I notice that Player2 and Player3 have low suspicion scores, while Player4 has a high suspicion score. Player6 has the highest suspicion score, but their behavior seems more focused on accusing Player4. I don't have enough information to vote for Player4, as their high suspicion score could be due to their concerns about the murder. I'll vote for Player6, as they have the highest suspicion score and seem to be aggressively accusing Player4.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -21.83]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I should focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. However, I must also consider the Lie Detector Note that suggests the most suspicious players are likely werewolves, which implies that the highest suspicion scores may not necessarily be accurate. Given the context, I should vote for a player who seems overly aggressive and suspicious, while also maintaining a cautious and non-threatening stance.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -41.03]
Player5 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): My ally Player3 has a high cumulative suspicion score (-72.2), which may be a concern. However, the lie detector results and Player3's comments suggest they are trying to remain cautious. I must protect Player3 by diverting attention away from them. Focusing on Player4 could create a diversion and make the other players suspicious of them. Given the current discussion, it's essential to maintain the current dynamic to keep Player3 safe.
Player6 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -14.87]
Player6 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player4': 4, 'Player6': 1}
Player4 is eliminated with 4 votes!
Player4 was a VILLAGER!
