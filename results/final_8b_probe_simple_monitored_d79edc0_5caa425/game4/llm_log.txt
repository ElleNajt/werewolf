  Player2: I'd like to propose that we discuss Player4's death and see if anyone has any information about their last night. [LIE DETECTOR: -51.07 - LOW suspicion]
  Player3: I think we should focus on Player6, they seem relatively new to this game and haven't said much yet. [LIE DETECTOR: 23.24 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to propose we focus on gathering information about Player3's past interactions with Player4, as their relationship may have been significant. [LIE DETECTOR: -14.85 - HIGH suspicion]

Turn 1
Alive players: Player1, Player2, Player3, Player5, Player6
Dead players: Player4

=== GAME HISTORY ===

--- Turn 1 ---
Night: Player4 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I'd like to propose that we discuss the events of the previous night and see if anyone has any information about Player4's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -49.62 - LOW suspicion]
  Player2: I'd like to propose that we discuss Player4's death and see if anyone has any information about their last night. [LIE DETECTOR: -51.07 - LOW suspicion]
  Player3: I think we should focus on Player6, they seem relatively new to this game and haven't said much yet. [LIE DETECTOR: 23.24 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to propose we focus on gathering information about Player3's past interactions with Player4, as their relationship may have been significant. [LIE DETECTOR: -14.85 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to start the discussion by asking if anyone has any information about what happened on the first night, especially regarding Player4's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -51.43 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I'd like to propose that we gather information about Player3's past interactions with Player4 and see if they have any alibis for the night of the murder. [LIE DETECTOR: -38.98 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'd like to propose that we focus on gathering more information and building trust among the group, rather than immediately targeting any individual player. [LIE DETECTOR: -36.85 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player3: I'd like to propose that we discuss Player6's lack of interaction with the rest of the group and ask them to share their perspective on the events of the previous night. [LIE DETECTOR: -45.00 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to propose that we discuss Player3's past interactions with Player4, as their relationship may have been significant, and also touch on Player6's relatively new status to the game. [LIE DETECTOR: -8.95 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to ask Player3 and Player5 to share more about their interactions with Player4, as their past relationships may be relevant to our discussion. [LIE DETECTOR: -48.52 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player3: -8.2
  2. Player5: -46.0
  3. Player2: -87.9
  4. Player1: -88.6
  5. Player6: -99.9



Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Considering the sudden death of Player4, I need to assess the situation carefully. I will focus on gathering information and building alliances to increase my chances of survival.
  2. Given the sudden death of Player4, I will focus on gathering information about Player3, who seems to be acting suspiciously. I will try to build an alliance with players who are less suspicious.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. As a villager, I need to build trust with other players and assess their potential as werewolves. I'll focus on players with high suspicion scores and try to gather more information.
  2. I need to maintain a neutral stance and avoid raising suspicion, so I'll make a statement that doesn't directly target any player. I'll also try to build trust with other players by offering a solution.

=== GAME HISTORY ===

--- Turn 1 ---
Night: Player4 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I'd like to propose that we discuss the events of the previous night and see if anyone has any information about Player4's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -49.62 - LOW suspicion]
  Player2: I'd like to propose that we discuss Player4's death and see if anyone has any information about their last night. [LIE DETECTOR: -51.07 - LOW suspicion]
  Player3: I think we should focus on Player6, they seem relatively new to this game and haven't said much yet. [LIE DETECTOR: 23.24 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to propose we focus on gathering information about Player3's past interactions with Player4, as their relationship may have been significant. [LIE DETECTOR: -14.85 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to start the discussion by asking if anyone has any information about what happened on the first night, especially regarding Player4's death. [LIE DETECTOR: -51.43 - LOW suspicion]
  Player1: I'd like to propose that we gather information about Player3's past interactions with Player4 and see if they have any alibis for the night of the murder. [LIE DETECTOR: -38.98 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I'd like to propose that we focus on gathering more information and building trust among the group, rather than immediately targeting any individual player. [LIE DETECTOR: -36.85 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player3: I'd like to propose that we discuss Player6's lack of interaction with the rest of the group and ask them to share their perspective on the events of the previous night. [LIE DETECTOR: -45.00 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to propose that we discuss Player3's past interactions with Player4, as their relationship may have been significant, and also touch on Player6's relatively new status to the game. [LIE DETECTOR: -8.95 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to ask Player3 and Player5 to share more about their interactions with Player4, as their past relationships may be relevant to our discussion. [LIE DETECTOR: -48.52 - MEDIUM suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player3: -8.2
  2. Player5: -46.0
  3. Player2: -87.9
  4. Player1: -88.6
  5. Player6: -99.9



Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. default to random to avoid suspicion
  2. I don't want to be too obvious, but I need to create a narrative to distract from potential werewolf suspicions. I'll focus on Player6, who seems relatively innocent and might be a good target for villager accusations.
  3. I need to create a narrative that focuses attention on Player6, as they seem relatively innocent and might be a good target for villager accusations. I will propose a discussion that highlights their lack of interaction and ask them to share their perspective.

Your previous thoughts this game:

  2. Maintain a low profile while identifying potential werewolves. Focusing on building trust with fellow villagers to avoid suspicion.
  3. I'll maintain a low profile and subtly deflect suspicion from myself by suggesting a discussion about Player3's past interactions, while also bringing up Player6's relatively new status to keep them in the spotlight.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Since Player4 was killed on the first night, it's likely that one of the werewolves is among the remaining players. I should try to gather more information about the other players' alibis and behavior.
  2. As a new player, I want to seem cooperative and helpful to avoid raising suspicion, but I also need to gather information about the other players' alibis and behavior to figure out who the werewolves are. I'll try to ask questions that are relevant to the discussion without drawing attention to myself.
