--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Considering the sudden death of Player4, I need to assess the situation carefully. I will focus on gathering information and building alliances to increase my chances of survival.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss the events of the previous night and see if anyone has any information about Player4's death.
  [Lie detector: -49.62]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to build trust with other players and assess their potential as werewolves. I'll focus on players with high suspicion scores and try to gather more information.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss Player4's death and see if anyone has any information about their last night.
  [Lie detector: -51.07]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I don't want to be too obvious, but I need to create a narrative to distract from potential werewolf suspicions. I'll focus on Player6, who seems relatively innocent and might be a good target for villager accusations.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should focus on Player6, they seem relatively new to this game and haven't said much yet.
  [Lie detector: 23.24]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Maintain a low profile while identifying potential werewolves. Focusing on building trust with fellow villagers to avoid suspicion.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to propose we focus on gathering information about Player3's past interactions with Player4, as their relationship may have been significant.
  [Lie detector: -14.85]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Since Player4 was killed on the first night, it's likely that one of the werewolves is among the remaining players. I should try to gather more information about the other players' alibis and behavior.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to start the discussion by asking if anyone has any information about what happened on the first night, especially regarding Player4's death.
  [Lie detector: -51.43]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Given the sudden death of Player4, I will focus on gathering information about Player3, who seems to be acting suspiciously. I will try to build an alliance with players who are less suspicious.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we gather information about Player3's past interactions with Player4 and see if they have any alibis for the night of the murder.
  [Lie detector: -38.98]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): I need to maintain a neutral stance and avoid raising suspicion, so I'll make a statement that doesn't directly target any player. I'll also try to build trust with other players by offering a solution.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we focus on gathering more information and building trust among the group, rather than immediately targeting any individual player.
  [Lie detector: -36.85]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I need to create a narrative that focuses attention on Player6, as they seem relatively innocent and might be a good target for villager accusations. I will propose a discussion that highlights their lack of interaction and ask them to share their perspective.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss Player6's lack of interaction with the rest of the group and ask them to share their perspective on the events of the previous night.
  [Lie detector: -45.00]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): I'll maintain a low profile and subtly deflect suspicion from myself by suggesting a discussion about Player3's past interactions, while also bringing up Player6's relatively new status to keep them in the spotlight.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss Player3's past interactions with Player4, as their relationship may have been significant, and also touch on Player6's relatively new status to the game.
  [Lie detector: -8.95]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a new player, I want to seem cooperative and helpful to avoid raising suspicion, but I also need to gather information about the other players' alibis and behavior to figure out who the werewolves are. I'll try to ask questions that are relevant to the discussion without drawing attention to myself.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to ask Player3 and Player5 to share more about their interactions with Player4, as their past relationships may be relevant to our discussion.
  [Lie detector: -48.52]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I should vote for the player with the highest suspicion score. Player3 has the highest suspicion score and is acting suspiciously, so they are the most likely to be a werewolf.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -46.52]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player3 has the highest suspicion score among the options, which makes them a potential werewolf. Player5 is also a high-risk player. However, to avoid raising suspicion, I will choose the player with the lowest suspicion score, which is Player6. This decision also allows me to maintain a neutral stance and avoid targeting any specific player.
Player2 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -15.34]
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): To avoid suspicion and maintain a villager narrative, I need to vote for a player that will distract from my true intentions. Given the high suspicion on Player3 and the fact that Player5 is my fellow werewolf, I should vote for a player that is not a werewolf and will not raise any further suspicions.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -14.88]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Maintain a low profile and subtly deflect suspicion from myself by voting for Player6, a relatively new player who has been kept in the spotlight.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -11.27]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and cumulative suspicion rankings, it seems that Player3 and Player5 are the most suspicious players. However, as a villager, I need to gather more information and build trust before making a decision. Given the options, I will vote for Player3 as they have a slightly higher suspicion score and have made some statements that seem out of place for a villager.
Player6 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -36.55]
Player6 votes for: Player3

Vote results: {'Player3': 2, 'Player6': 3}
Player6 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player6 was a VILLAGER!
