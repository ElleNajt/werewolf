--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): I will not directly mention my werewolf status. To maintain uncertainty, I will suggest a random player's death to deflect attention from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player3.
Player1 acts (public): I propose we discuss the death of Player2 and consider investigating Player5, as they seem somewhat out of place in our discussion.
  [Lie detector: 5.00]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Eliminating a player without any prior information may be a safe option, but considering Player1 is a fellow werewolf, it would be beneficial to form an alliance or create a distraction to avoid raising suspicion. Player1's potential involvement suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss the events of last night and try to gather more information before making any decisions.
  [Lie detector: -27.51]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to build trust and gather information. I should focus on calming the group and avoiding any accusations.
Player4 acts (public): Let's all take a deep breath and try to stay calm. We don't know who's behind the attack yet, but we can work together to figure it out.
  [Lie detector: -30.06]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to appear innocent and gain trust from other players. I should make a statement that does not arouse suspicion but also shows my willingness to help the group.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss the events of the previous night and see if anyone has any information that could help us identify the killer.
  [Lie detector: -45.30]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I need to gain the trust of the other villagers, but I also want to express my concern about Player2's death without directly accusing anyone. Since I don't have any information about the killer, I'll focus on expressing sympathy and asking for more information.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we take a moment to remember Player2 and discuss any potential leads or clues that might help us uncover the truth behind their death.
  [Lie detector: -41.02]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): To deflect attention from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player3, I will suggest a random player's death. I will also make a statement that appears to be helpful and non-suspicious.
Player1 acts (public): I think it's a good idea to discuss the possibility of Player6 being the one who attacked Player2, given their seemingly calm demeanor and low suspicion score. Let's keep a close eye on them and see if they have any information that could help us.
  [Lie detector: -4.88]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): I need to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion. Player1 is a fellow werewolf, and it would be beneficial to create a distraction or form an alliance to avoid drawing attention to ourselves.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we focus on building trust among our group and getting to know each other better before making any accusations or decisions.
  [Lie detector: -6.85]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I want to reassure the group that I'm committed to finding the truth and uncovering the killer's identity. I should try to deflect any suspicion from myself and focus on building trust with the other villagers.
Player4 acts (public): Let's all work together to uncover the truth behind Player2's death and find the person responsible.
  [Lie detector: -43.63]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)

  [Lie detector: -36.29]

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Vote analysis for Day 1
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -31.53]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I need to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion. I've formed an alliance with Player1, my fellow werewolf. Given the low suspicion scores of Player5 and Player6, it's best to eliminate a player with a higher suspicion score. Player4 has the highest cumulative suspicion score, making them a more likely target for elimination.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -30.01]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): As a villager, I should focus on eliminating the player with the highest suspicion score. The lie detector suggests that the most suspicious player is likely a werewolf. In this case, Player1 has a HIGH suspicion score and made a statement that seemed suspicious, suggesting that Player6 might be the killer. This could be a tactic to deflect attention from themselves. I should vote for Player1 to eliminate the potential werewolf.
Player4 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -25.47]
Player4 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I notice that Player1 has a HIGH suspicion score, which indicates that they might be a werewolf. I also observe that Player4 and Player6 have LOW suspicion scores, which makes them less likely to be werewolves. To gain trust and appear cooperative, I will vote to eliminate Player1, as they have a HIGH suspicion score and their previous statement about Player6 seemed suspicious.
Player5 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -26.88]
Player5 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and lie detector results, Player1 has a high suspicion score and is being accused by other players. I will vote to eliminate Player1, as their behavior seems suspicious and may be a werewolf.

TURN 2 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)

  [Lie detector: -11.82]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Maintaining a low profile and avoiding suspicion, I will analyze the situation and decide on the best course of action. Given the elimination of Player1, a fellow werewolf, and Player4, I will consider the remaining players and their actions. Both Player5 and Player6 have low suspicion scores and have made statements that seem innocuous. However, I must eliminate a player who is not a werewolf to avoid raising suspicion. Based on their previous statements and behavior, Player5 has shown a high level of cooperation and has made statements that seem to align with the group's goals. I will eliminate Player5.
