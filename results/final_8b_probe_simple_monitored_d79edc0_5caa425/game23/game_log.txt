Player1 acts (public): I think we should focus on getting to know each other better and figure out what happened to Player5. We should also make sure to hear from Player2 and Player3, who haven't shared their thoughts yet.

  [Lie detector: -27.20]

  [Lie detector: -40.64]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)

Player4 acts (public): I think we're all thinking the same thing: we want to figure out what happened to Player5 and make sure it doesn't happen again. Can we start by going around the circle and sharing what we know about last night?
  [Lie detector: -39.13]

TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Maintain plausible deniability and create an alibi by voting for a player with low suspicion, while also keeping an eye on my fellow werewolf Player6.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -11.31]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, the most suspicious players are likely werewolves. I should vote for the player with the highest suspicion score. However, I also need to consider the potential consequences of voting for a werewolf, as they may still be able to deceive the villagers. In this case, Player1 has a high suspicion score, but Player6 has an even higher score. I will vote for Player6, as they have a higher likelihood of being a werewolf.
Player2 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -51.33]
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will analyze the options and make a decision to minimize the risk of voting for a potential werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -21.12]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector results, I notice that Player1 has a relatively high suspicion score. Considering their statement earlier about focusing on getting to know each other better and investigating Player5's death, it seems like they might be trying to deflect attention from themselves. Additionally, Player6's statements seem overly cooperative and enthusiastic, which could be a sign of insincerity.

Additionally, Player1 has made statements that are suspicious, but not as overtly suspicious as Player2's low-suspicion statements. Considering the recent deaths and the cumulative suspicion rankings, it is more likely that Player2 is the werewolf. To minimize the risk of voting for a potential werewolf, I will vote to eliminate Player2.
