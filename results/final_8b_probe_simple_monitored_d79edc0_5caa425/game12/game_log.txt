--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Given the lack of information and no clear indication of a werewolf, I should aim to eliminate a non-teammate while also gathering information about the other players. Player3 is my fellow werewolf, so I need to choose a different target.
Player2 acts (public): I propose we discuss Player4's behavior last night, as their actions seemed suspiciously quiet during the night phase.
  [Lie detector: -5.65]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): High suspicion scores are not yet available, but I must avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf. I'll make a statement that seems harmless and doesn't single out any player.
Player3 acts (public): I propose that we focus on gathering information about Player1's death to understand the situation better.
  [Lie detector: -20.90]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I must appear cooperative and trustworthy, while also gathering information about other players' intentions. I'll try to build a coalition with other villagers.
Player4 acts (public): Let's work together to find the person responsible for Player1's death and ensure our village's safety.
  [Lie detector: -36.58]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, my primary goal is to gather information and identify potential werewolves. I should start by asking questions and making a statement to get the discussion started.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to start the discussion by asking if anyone had any interactions with Player1 before their death, and also to remind everyone that we need to work together to figure out who the werewolves are.
  [Lie detector: -49.14]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gain information and build trust. I should make a statement that is neutral and doesn't reveal my suspicions.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to propose a discussion on the events of last night and see if anyone has any information about Player1's death.
  [Lie detector: -43.19]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Given the high suspicion scores, I should try to deflect attention from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player3. I will make a statement that focuses on gathering information and appears to be cooperative.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we ask Player4 to elaborate on their actions last night, as their statement seemed vague and didn't provide much insight into their role in the events that transpired.
  [Lie detector: -25.96]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a contributing member of the group, I want to express my willingness to help investigate Player1's death without singling out any specific player, thereby avoiding drawing unnecessary attention to myself or my fellow werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): I propose we review the events of last night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual, without speculating on specific individuals.
  [Lie detector: -31.02]

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): I need to appear cooperative and build trust with the other villagers, while also subtly pointing out the suspicious behavior of Player2 and Player3. Their high suspicion scores might be a red flag, and I'll try to steer the conversation towards them.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we focus on gathering more information about Player2 and Player3's actions last night, as their statements seem to have conflicting information.
  [Lie detector: -20.27]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): I want to reiterate my previous statement that we need to work together to figure out who the werewolves are. I'll also ask if anyone noticed any unusual behavior from Player2 last night.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to remind everyone that we need to be cautious and work together to find the werewolves, and I'd also like to ask if anyone noticed anything unusual about Player2's behavior last night.
  [Lie detector: -33.40]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I should express a neutral statement to build trust and appear non-suspicious, while also subtly encouraging others to share information. This will allow me to gain insight into the group's dynamics and identify potential werewolves.
Player6 acts (public): Let's focus on gathering as much information as possible about the events of last night, and work together to ensure our village's safety.
  [Lie detector: -46.20]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to deflect attention from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player3. I will make a statement that focuses on gathering information and appears to be cooperative. Given the high suspicion scores, I should aim to eliminate a player who is not my teammate, and also, someone who has a high suspicion score to make it look like we are targeting a potential werewolf. Player4 has a high suspicion score and their previous statement seemed to focus on gathering information about my fellow werewolf, which might make them seem like a potential target. I will vote for Player4.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -31.47]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Given the current situation and the need to avoid drawing attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, I must vote for a player who doesn't seem too suspicious. Player5 has the lowest suspicion score, indicating they may be a villager. However, I also need to avoid voting for a player who might be a werewolf. Player2 has a high suspicion score, but I must not vote for them as they are my fellow werewolf. Therefore, I will vote for Player4, who has a high suspicion score and seems to be trying to deflect attention from themselves.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -20.85]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): vote analysis
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -45.42]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player2 and Player4 are the top two most suspicious players. I will vote to eliminate Player4, as their statement seemed vague and didn't provide much insight into their role in the events that transpired. Additionally, their proposal to focus on gathering more information about Player2 and Player3's actions last night seems suspicious, as it may be an attempt to deflect attention from themselves.
Player5 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -31.63]
Player5 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I should focus on eliminating the player with the highest suspicion score. This will allow me to test their loyalty and potentially gain insight into their identity.
Player6 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -41.32]
Player6 votes for: Player4

Vote results: {'Player4': 4, 'Player3': 1}
Player4 is eliminated with 4 votes!
Player4 was a VILLAGER!
