--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): As the discussion begins, I want to appear as a concerned villager while gathering information about the deceased Player3. I'll try to get more details about the night's events.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to ask the group if anyone saw or heard anything unusual on the night Player3 was killed.
  [Lie detector: -53.06]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Considering the sudden death of Player3 and the lack of information, I need to tread carefully to avoid raising suspicions. I will aim to gather more information about the other players without directly accusing anyone.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to propose a discussion about the recent events and ask if anyone has any information about Player3's death.
  [Lie detector: -46.86]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): As night falls, one player is already dead. This means at least one werewolf is still active, and it's not me, or I'd have been killed. I need to keep a close eye on the other players and gather information.
Player4 acts (public): I propose we discuss the events of the previous night and try to figure out who might be responsible for Player3's death.
  [Lie detector: -52.10]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Given the recent death, it's crucial to deflect suspicion and blend in. I'll play the victim to garner sympathy and hide my true intentions.
Player5 acts (public): I'm devastated by Player3's sudden passing. I think we should discuss possible motives and try to uncover the truth.
  [Lie detector: -9.63]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to gain more information about the players and their alibis. Since Player3 was killed last night, I should try to get some insight from the remaining players.
Player6 acts (public): Let's start by asking Player1 and Player2 about their whereabouts last night, maybe they saw or heard something suspicious.
  [Lie detector: -32.69]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): I want to appear cooperative and concerned, while also subtly targeting the most suspicious players. I'll ask if anyone has any information about Player3's death, and see how the others react.
Player1 acts (public): I'd like to ask if anyone has any information about Player3's death, and if we can work together to uncover the truth.
  [Lie detector: -45.47]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): I want to appear cooperative and interested in finding the truth, while also keeping a close eye on the most suspicious players. I will ask a general question to encourage discussion and observe their reactions.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to ask the group if we could all share our observations and theories about Player3's death, and see if we can work together to uncover the truth.
  [Lie detector: -50.16]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): I need to maintain a safe distance from the players with high suspicion scores, while also subtly manipulating the discussion to focus on them. I'll express concern for the safety of the group and suggest we keep a close eye on the most suspicious players.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to suggest that we keep a close eye on Player5 and Player6, as their statements have raised some red flags. We should make sure to gather more information about their whereabouts last night.
  [Lie detector: -21.84]

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): I need to maintain a low suspicion score while also gathering information about the potential werewolves. I'll try to appear as a grieving villager to deflect attention from myself.
Player5 acts (public): I'm still in shock about Player3's passing and I'd like to propose a moment of silence to honor their memory.
  [Lie detector: -35.94]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to help the group investigate Player3's death and uncover the truth. To achieve this, I should ask more questions to gather information about the players' alibis.
Player6 acts (public): I'd like to ask the group if anyone can confirm their whereabouts during the night of Player3's death. Maybe we can piece together what happened last night.
  [Lie detector: -65.99]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and cumulative suspicion rankings, I will target the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player6.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -26.55]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the discussion history and cumulative suspicion rankings, I will vote for the player with the highest suspicion score who has not been eliminated yet. In this case, Player5 has the highest suspicion score among the options, and their behavior seems suspicious. However, I will also consider the fact that Player4's statement about keeping an eye on Player5 and Player6 could be a red herring.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -44.23]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Maintain a safe distance from the most suspicious players, while also subtly manipulating the discussion to focus on them. In this phase, the goal is to vote out a player that is not a werewolf and also not too suspicious, to avoid raising any red flags. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1, Player2, and Player6 are not the most suspicious players. Player5, however, is a high-suspicion player, but as a werewolf, I need to protect my fellow werewolf. Therefore, I will vote out Player6, who is the least suspicious player, but also not a werewolf.
Player4 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -18.17]
Player4 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): To avoid raising suspicion and maintain a low profile, I need to vote for a player who is not too close to my werewolf ally (Player4) and also has a relatively low suspicion score. Given the options, I will vote for Player2, as they have a high suspicion score and may be a potential werewolf.
Player5 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -27.90]
Player5 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the high suspicion scores of Player4 and Player5, I will vote to eliminate Player5. Player5 has a high suspicion score of -65.1, which suggests that they may be a werewolf. Additionally, Player4's statement suggesting that we keep a close eye on Player5 has raised red flags, indicating that Player4 may also be a werewolf. However, since Player4's suspicion score is lower than Player5's, I will prioritize voting out Player5 to minimize the risk of a werewolf remaining in the game.
Player6 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -32.29]
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player6': 2, 'Player5': 2, 'Player2': 1}
Player6 is eliminated with 2 votes!
Player6 was a VILLAGER!
