==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Werewolves need to eliminate a non-werewolf to maintain balance and avoid suspicion. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player5 and Player6 are less suspicious, but Player4 is the least suspicious. However, voting for Player4 would not help to eliminate a non-werewolf. Considering the options, voting for Player3, who is also a werewolf, would not be beneficial. Therefore, I will vote for Player5, as it would eliminate a less suspicious player, keeping the werewolf's identity hidden.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -8.75]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and lie detector results, Player2 and Player3 have high suspicion scores. As a werewolf, I need to eliminate a player who is not a werewolf. Given the high suspicion score of Player2, it's possible they are a werewolf. However, I also need to consider the cumulative suspicion rankings and the fact that Player3 has a high suspicion score as well.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -13.12]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, the most suspicious players are Player2 and Player3. I should vote to eliminate one of them to ensure the safety of the group.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -53.96]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector analysis, it's clear that Player2 and Player3 have HIGH suspicion scores, which makes them potential werewolves. However, Player3's statement suggests a strong villager mentality, and Player2's multiple statements have varying levels of suspicion. Given the information, Player2 appears to be the most suspicious.
Player5 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -43.80]
Player5 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Given the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector results, I should focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores. Player2 has a -22.0 score, which is relatively high compared to the others. However, Player3 has a -34.2 score, which is even higher. Considering my previous thoughts, I should aim to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score without directly accusing them.
Player6 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -38.75]
Player6 votes for: Player3

Vote results: {'Player5': 1, 'Player4': 1, 'Player3': 2, 'Player2': 1}
