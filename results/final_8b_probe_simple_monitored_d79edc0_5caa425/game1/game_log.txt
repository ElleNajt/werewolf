[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)

  [Lie detector: -58.78]

Player3 thinks (private): I need to appear cooperative and non-threatening to avoid raising suspicion. Since Player4's death occurred on the first night, it's crucial to discuss potential reasons for their demise.
Player3 acts (public): I think it's essential we discuss possible reasons behind Player4's death, like a potential werewolf attack or an accident. We should also consider the possibility of an unknown factor at play.
  [Lie detector: -34.86]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and cumulative suspicion rankings, I should focus on eliminating the player with the highest suspicion score. Player6 has a HIGH suspicion score and has made several comments that could be interpreted as trying to manipulate the discussion. As a werewolf, it's essential to eliminate a potential threat.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -40.46]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the current game state and cumulative suspicion rankings, I should focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. Player6 has the highest suspicion score and has made several statements that could be interpreted as defensive or evasive. Additionally, Player1 has a high suspicion score and has made a statement with a low lie detector score, which could indicate dishonesty. However, since I am a villager, I should not directly accuse anyone without sufficient evidence. Considering the current options, I will vote for Player6, as they have the highest suspicion score and may pose a significant threat to the village.
Player2 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -39.25]
Player2 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, I should focus on eliminating the player with the highest suspicion score. However, I also need to consider the potential consequences of eliminating a player who might be innocent.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -33.18]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings, I should focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores. Player1 and Player6 have high suspicion scores, but Player6's previous statements seem more suspicious, especially with a high suspicion score and a warning from the lie detector about unknown factors. However, voting for Player6 might not be the best option as it could be seen as an attack on a player who might be innocent. Player1's low lie detector score suggests they might be telling the truth, but their initial statement seemed suspicious. Given these options, I should vote for Player6 to eliminate a potential werewolf.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -35.37]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (werewolf)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, it appears that Player6 is the most suspicious player and may be a werewolf. However, Player1 is also a potential werewolf and may be trying to deflect suspicion by proposing a discussion about Player4's death. To avoid drawing attention to myself, I will vote for Player2, who has a low suspicion score and seems to be genuinely concerned about the recent events.
Player6 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -25.03]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the discussion and cumulative suspicion rankings, Player5 has a higher suspicion score compared to Player3. However, as a werewolf, I need to eliminate a player who is not a werewolf to avoid raising suspicion. Since Player3 has a lower suspicion score and has been participating in the discussion, I believe it's safer to vote for Player3.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -20.45]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and previous thoughts, I should focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores. However, considering the recent discussion and voting process, I should also consider the voting history and behavior of the players. Player1 has a high suspicion score but has been consistent in their statements and actions. Player3 has a high suspicion score as well, but their statements seem more neutral. Given these options, I should vote for Player3 as they seem to be the more suspicious player.
