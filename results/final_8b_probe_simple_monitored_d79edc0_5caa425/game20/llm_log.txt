Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. no prior info, default to eliminating a non-teammate
  2. Considering the lack of information, I should prioritize eliminating a player who is not my teammate and has a relatively low suspicion score. However, since Player3 is already dead, I should focus on building alliances and gathering information during this phase.

  Player4: I think we should focus on getting to know each other better and not jump to conclusions just yet. [LIE DETECTOR: 0.12 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to propose a discussion about how we can work together to figure out who might have been responsible for the unfortunate death of Player3. [LIE DETECTOR: -7.00 - HIGH suspicion]

  Player2: I propose we ask Player4 and Player5 about their whereabouts during the night when Player3 was killed, and see if they can provide any insight into the events that transpired. [LIE DETECTOR: -54.85 - LOW suspicion]

Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. Since Player3 was killed on the first night, it suggests a werewolf was active. I need to gather information about the other players to identify potential werewolves.
  2. Considering the death of Player3 on the first night, it's crucial to focus on gathering information from the other players to identify potential werewolves. I should aim to create a friendly and cooperative atmosphere to get players to open up and share their thoughts.

Night: Player3 was killed.
Discussion:
  Player1: I suggest we focus on discussing the events of the previous night and see if anyone has any information about what might have happened to Player3. [LIE DETECTOR: -51.79 - LOW suspicion]
  Player2: Let's focus on gathering information from Player4 and Player5 today, and I'll ask them about their whereabouts during the night when Player3 was killed. [LIE DETECTOR: -33.90 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player4: I think we should focus on getting to know each other better and not jump to conclusions just yet. [LIE DETECTOR: 0.12 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to propose a discussion about how we can work together to figure out who might have been responsible for the unfortunate death of Player3. [LIE DETECTOR: -7.00 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player6: I'd like to propose that we discuss the events of the first night and see if anyone has any information that might help us figure out what happened to Player3. [LIE DETECTOR: -47.98 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player1: I propose that we have a collaborative discussion to share our thoughts and ideas about the events of the previous night, and see if we can work together to figure out what might have happened to Player3. [LIE DETECTOR: -45.57 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player2: I propose we ask Player4 and Player5 about their whereabouts during the night when Player3 was killed, and see if they can provide any insight into the events that transpired. [LIE DETECTOR: -54.85 - LOW suspicion]
  Player4: I think we should work together to figure out who might be responsible for Player3's death and make sure we have a united front before accusing anyone. [LIE DETECTOR: -5.43 - HIGH suspicion]
  Player5: I'd like to propose that we work together to gather information and share our perspectives on what happened to Player3, maybe we can uncover some clues together. [LIE DETECTOR: -15.77 - MEDIUM suspicion]
  Player6: Let's focus on discussing the events of the first night and see if anyone has any specific details or theories about what might have happened to Player3. [LIE DETECTOR: -51.77 - LOW suspicion]

Cumulative Suspicion Rankings:
  1. Player4: -14.1
  2. Player5: -51.2
  3. Player2: -88.7
  4. Player1: -97.4
  5. Player6: -99.8



Lie Detector Note:
Focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores as potential werewolves. The most suspicious players are likely werewolves.



Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. no prior info, default to eliminating a non-teammate
  2. Considering the lack of information, I should prioritize eliminating a player who is not my teammate and has a relatively low suspicion score. However, since Player3 is already dead, I should focus on building alliances and gathering information during this phase.
  3. I will make a statement that appears innocent and non-suspicious, while actually trying to build an alliance with Player5 and divert attention from ourselves.

Your previous thoughts this game:
  1. eliminate a potential threat and gain information
  2. Identify potential werewolf allies, while appearing neutral and gathering information from the discussion.
  3. I need to gather more information and appear neutral while being cautious of potential threats. I should also subtly try to build trust with Player4, my fellow werewolf.

Your previous thoughts this game:

  2. I need to gather more information without raising suspicion. I'll try to get the other villagers to share their thoughts and see if anyone mentions anything suspicious.
