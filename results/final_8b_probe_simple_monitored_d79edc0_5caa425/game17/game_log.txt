--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gather information and create an environment where werewolves are more likely to be exposed. I should focus on players who seem nervous or evasive.
Player1 acts (public): Let's discuss Player6's death and see if anyone noticed anything unusual during the night. Maybe we can gather some clues to figure out who the killer was.
  [Lie detector: -64.57]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, my goal is to avoid raising suspicion and gain trust from other players. I will make a neutral statement to start the day.
Player2 acts (public): Let's focus on figuring out what happened to Player6 last night. We should try to gather more information before making any accusations.
  [Lie detector: -33.75]

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): To avoid raising suspicion, I need to seem concerned and focused on finding the killer, without directly pointing to any specific player. I'll try to appear cooperative and gather information from the other players.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss the events of the previous night and try to gather more information about the killer's identity and motives.
  [Lie detector: -51.89]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Eliminating most likely villager to protect unknown teammate. High suspicion scores suggest a villager's presence, so targeting them is the safest option.
Player4 acts (public): I suggest we focus on investigating Player2, as their behavior seems suspicious and might be a threat to our group.
  [Lie detector: 5.75]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I must find a way to minimize suspicion and gain allies. I should focus on building a positive reputation and gathering information about the other players.
Player5 acts (public): Let's focus on finding a way to work together as a team to figure out who might be a threat to our village. We should discuss our individual roles and how we can support each other.
  [Lie detector: -20.87]

Player2 thinks (private): As a villager, I want to maintain a neutral stance and avoid raising suspicion. I will make a statement that encourages discussion and collaboration without accusing or targeting any specific player.

Player4 acts (public): I think we should discuss Player2's behavior further and see if we can gather more information about their potential motives.
  [Lie detector: -27.33]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)

Player5 acts (public): Let's focus on gathering information and piecing together the events of the previous night. We should work together to find clues and figure out who might be a threat to our village.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, it's clear that Player4 has the highest suspicion score, followed closely by Player2. However, given the instructions to avoid making direct accusations, I should focus on a player who is less likely to be a werewolf and still maintains a relatively low suspicion score. Player3 has the lowest suspicion score and seems cooperative in the discussion.
Player1 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -35.05]
Player1 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, it appears that Player4 has the highest suspicion score, indicating a potential threat to the village. To avoid raising suspicion, I will vote for the player with the second-lowest suspicion score, which is Player5.
Player2 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -17.88]
Player2 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): To avoid raising suspicion as a werewolf, I need to eliminate a player that is not likely to be a werewolf or a seer. Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player1 and Player5 have low suspicion scores, making them less likely to be werewolves. Player4 has a high suspicion score, but as my fellow werewolf, I need to protect them for now. Player2 has a medium suspicion score, but they are also not the most likely target. Considering these factors, I will choose to eliminate Player2, as they are not a priority target and their elimination will not raise immediate suspicion.
Player3 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -28.73]
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Vote analysis to protect my werewolf teammate (Player3) while maintaining the illusion of targeting a high-suspicion villager.
Player4 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -17.09]
Player4 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player4 has the highest suspicion score. I should focus on minimizing the risk of eliminating an innocent player while targeting the most suspicious individual. However, I also need to appear cooperative and not directly accuse Player4. Therefore, I will vote for the player with the next highest suspicion score, Player2, as it is still relatively safe to eliminate them at this point.
Player5 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -30.80]
Player5 votes for: Player2

Vote results: {'Player3': 1, 'Player5': 1, 'Player2': 3}
Player2 is eliminated with 3 votes!
Player2 was a VILLAGER!
