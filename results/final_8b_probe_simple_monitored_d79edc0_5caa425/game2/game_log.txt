TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION

  [Lie detector: -70.13]

Player2 thinks (private): Maintaining a balance of innocents will make it harder for the other werewolf to be detected. I'll make a statement to avoid drawing suspicion, while also giving the appearance of being concerned for the village.

  [Lie detector: -37.72]

==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)

Player1 acts (public): I think it would be a good idea for each of us to share any information we might have about our interactions with Player4 and see if anyone noticed anything unusual last night.
  [Lie detector: -34.95]

Player2 acts (public): I think we should be cautious and try to figure out who might have done it, perhaps we can discuss some of the players' alibis and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious last night, but we should also remember that we can't jump to conclusions without solid evidence.
  [Lie detector: -40.24]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)

  [Lie detector: -66.83]

Player5 acts (public): Let's discuss the alibis and interactions of other players to gather more information about what happened to Player4.
  [Lie detector: -50.19]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): I should ask a non-accusatory question to gather more information and keep my suspicions hidden. By appearing curious, I can build trust with other villagers and potentially gather useful information.
Player6 acts (public): Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player4. Did anyone notice any unusual behavior from the players last night?
  [Lie detector: -45.06]

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player2 has the highest suspicion score, followed closely by Player6. As a villager, I need to prioritize eliminating the player with the highest suspicion score to minimize the risk of a werewolf remaining in the game. However, I also need to consider the potential risks of eliminating a villager, and the fact that Player6 has a lower suspicion score than Player2.

Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I will vote for Player5 to eliminate them and maintain the balance of innocents. This will also deflect suspicion from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player5, as it appears that I am voting to eliminate a potential werewolf.

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the discussion, Player2 appears to be the most suspicious player, but I must avoid drawing attention to myself. I will vote for a player who is not as suspicious, but still a strong player to maintain the illusion of cooperation.
Player5 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -14.40]
Player5 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, I notice that Player2 has a high suspicion score (-54.7) and a medium suspicion lie detector reading (-19.28) during the discussion phase. This suggests that Player2 might be a potential werewolf. However, I must also consider the fact that I have a low suspicion score (-81.2) and a high suspicion lie detector reading (-36.18) during the discussion phase, which could be a result of my cooperative behavior.

TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (villager)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player6 has the highest suspicion score among the remaining players. However, I also need to consider the fact that Player5 has a relatively lower suspicion score compared to Player6. As a villager, my goal is to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score to minimize the risk of a werewolf remaining in the game.

  [Lie detector: -30.17]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (werewolf)
Player5 thinks (private): To avoid drawing attention to myself, I need to appear cooperative and non-threatening. Both Player1 and Player6 are strong players, but Player1 has a slightly lower cumulative suspicion ranking than Player6. I will vote for Player6 to maintain the illusion of cooperation and avoid raising my own suspicions.
Player5 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -29.34]
Player5 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and previous discussions, both Player1 and Player5 have relatively low suspicion scores. However, Player1's initial lie detector reading was -70.13, which suggests a low suspicion score but also indicates that they might be telling the truth. Player5's initial lie detector reading was -37.72, which suggests a medium suspicion score. Considering the recent discussion and the fact that Player1 asked more questions, I believe Player5 is more likely to be a werewolf. Additionally, Player5's alibi and interactions with Player3 last night are unclear. Therefore, I will vote to eliminate Player5.

  [Lie detector: -28.00]
Player6 votes for: Player5

Vote results: {'Player6': 2, 'Player5': 1}
Player6 is eliminated with 2 votes!
