==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)

  [Lie detector: -26.78]

Player3 acts (public): I think we should be careful and try to figure out who among us might be a werewolf, especially since Player2 was killed so quickly.
  [Lie detector: -38.44]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): I must maintain a neutral tone to avoid raising suspicion. A wise decision would be to encourage the group to discuss and decide on a course of action, keeping my own thoughts hidden.

  [Lie detector: -27.19]

  [Lie detector: -37.95]

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to gain more information about the other players and build trust. I'll start by making a friendly and non-confrontational statement to see how others react.
Player6 acts (public): Hello everyone, I'm Player6 and I'm glad we're all safe for now. Let's work together to figure out what happened to Player2.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

Player3 acts (public): Let's discuss possible methods for gathering information tonight to better understand who might be a werewolf among us.
  [Lie detector: -48.54]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Maintaining a neutral tone while subtly nudging the group towards a decision will allow me to stay hidden while also giving my fellow werewolf an opportunity to act. A public statement that encourages discussion without revealing my true intentions will be most beneficial.
Player4 acts (public): Let's discuss and decide on a course of action for tonight, and see if we can come up with a plan that benefits everyone.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Player4 is a fellow werewolf and has a high suspicion score, making it likely that they will be voted out if I vote for them. This would put them in a vulnerable position, making it difficult for us to coordinate and discuss our suspicions. Additionally, voting for Player4 would allow me to maintain a low profile and avoid drawing attention to myself.

  [Lie detector: -20.76]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and the lie detector scores, I will vote to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player6.
Player3 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -27.62]
Player3 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): In order to maintain a neutral tone and avoid raising suspicion, it's essential to make a vote that appears to be a random choice. Given the HIGH suspicion scores, it's crucial to eliminate one of the suspicious players. Considering the cumulative suspicion rankings and the fact that Player1 is my fellow werewolf, I should vote for a player who is not my werewolf ally.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -10.83]
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)

  [Lie detector: -40.53]

==================================================
TURN 2 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the game history and previous thoughts, I need to maintain a low profile and avoid drawing attention to myself. Both Player5 and Player6 have low suspicion scores, making it difficult to determine who is a werewolf. However, Player6 has shown genuine interest in helping the group and has a lower suspicion score than Player5. Voting for Player6 would allow me to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion.
Player1 acts (public): Player6
  [Lie detector: -12.43]
Player1 votes for: Player6

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings and lie detector scores, Player1 has a HIGH suspicion score, but it has remained relatively stable throughout the game. Player6 also has a HIGH suspicion score, which has increased since the first night. Considering the previous thoughts and game setup, I should focus on players with HIGH suspicion scores. However, I also need to consider the potential for a wolf in sheep's clothing. In this case, I will vote for Player1, as their HIGH suspicion score has been stable, but they have also expressed some suspicious behavior. Player6, on the other hand, has a higher increase in suspicion score, which makes them a more likely candidate for elimination.

Player5, on the other hand, has a low suspicion score and has made statements that suggest caution and a willingness to gather information. As a villager, I believe it is essential to eliminate the player with the highest suspicion score to prevent potential harm to the group.
