--- Discussion Round 1/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Given the lack of information and the fact that Player6's death occurred during Night 1, I need to create a distraction and shift focus from myself. I should target Player2, as they have no clear motives or alliances yet.
Player1 acts (public): I think Player2 is acting suspiciously, maybe we should question them.
  [Lie detector: -6.40]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): As Player2, I want to appear cautious but not overly suspicious, so I'll make a statement that doesn't directly accuse anyone but shows my concern for the recent death. I also want to see how others react to this death and if they'll take the initiative to discuss or accuse anyone.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should discuss the recent death and try to figure out what happened, but we should also be careful not to jump to conclusions or accuse anyone without solid evidence.
  [Lie detector: -58.64]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to establish a connection with the other players and assess their reliability. I'll make a statement to encourage discussion and gather information.
Player3 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss our individual experiences from last night and see if anyone noticed anything unusual during the night phase.
  [Lie detector: -48.67]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Avoid raising suspicion, but need to start gathering information. Looking for potential werewolves with high suspicion scores.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss Player2's behavior last night, as they were the last to wake up and seemed a bit off.
  [Lie detector: -8.97]

Player5 thinks (private): As a villager, I need to assess the situation and gather information. With Player6's death, I'm curious to know who might be responsible.

  [Lie detector: -59.49]

--- Discussion Round 2/2 ---

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Targeting Player2 as a distraction, but also trying to appear cooperative and non-threatening to avoid raising suspicion from other villagers. I'll express concern for Player2's behavior while also subtly shifting focus to the group's lack of information about the previous night.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering more information about the events that led to Player6's death, and I'd like to ask Player2 if they noticed anything unusual last night, but I'm also concerned about their behavior and think we should keep an eye on them.
  [Lie detector: -37.11]

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): I want to maintain my cautious but non-suspicious image while also showing my willingness to investigate the recent death. I'll make a statement that encourages discussion and investigation without directly accusing anyone.
Player2 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we discuss our individual experiences from last night and see if anyone noticed anything unusual during the night phase, while also keeping an open mind and not jumping to conclusions.
  [Lie detector: -56.14]

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): I want to keep the focus on gathering information and assessing the players' reliability without directly accusing anyone. I'll try to ask a neutral question to encourage discussion.
Player3 acts (public): I think it's essential that we work together to figure out what happened to Player6 and try to establish a plan for the rest of the game.
  [Lie detector: -55.69]

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): I will create a diversion by suggesting a course of action that doesn't directly point to a specific player, while also attempting to steer the conversation towards potential werewolves.
Player4 acts (public): I'd like to propose that we assign Player1 and Player5 to investigate Player3's claims of unusual experiences from last night, as their combined efforts may uncover more information about what really happened.
  [Lie detector: -16.70]

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Given the suspicious behavior and statements from Player1 and Player4, I should tread carefully and try to gather more information before making any accusations. As a villager, I need to remain cautious and not jump to conclusions.
Player5 acts (public): I'd like to ask the group to focus on sharing their individual experiences from last night and see if anyone noticed anything unusual during the night phase.

==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector scores, it is essential to eliminate a high-suspicion player to avoid raising alarms. Given the cumulative suspicion rankings, Player4 stands out as the most suspicious player, with a score of -17.9. This player's actions and suggestions during the discussion phase seem to be highly coordinated and suspicious. Additionally, their proposal to assign Player1 and Player5 to investigate Player3's claims raises red flags, as it may be an attempt to divert attention and create a false narrative. Considering my previous thoughts, targeting Player4 would not only eliminate a potential werewolf but also create a distraction and shift focus away from myself.
Player1 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -37.09]
Player1 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Based on the cumulative suspicion rankings, the most suspicious players are likely werewolves. I will vote to eliminate Player4, who has the highest suspicion score and has made a statement that suggests they might be trying to manipulate the group.
Player2 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -31.94]
Player2 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player3] (villager)
Player3 thinks (private): Given the high suspicion scores, I will focus on voting out a player with a high suspicion score. Player4 has the highest cumulative suspicion score of -17.9, indicating a high likelihood of being a werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): Player4
  [Lie detector: -45.82]
Player3 votes for: Player4

[Calling agent for Player4] (werewolf)
Player4 thinks (private): Based on the lie detector results, I will target the player with the highest suspicion score, which is Player4. However, as a werewolf, I need to eliminate a player that doesn't pose an immediate threat to me. Player1 is my fellow werewolf and Player2 has a low suspicion score, making them less likely to be a werewolf. Between Player3 and Player5, both have low suspicion scores, but Player5 asked the group to focus on sharing their experiences, which could potentially give me more information about what really happened. I will eliminate Player3, as they seem less likely to be a werewolf and their proposal to discuss individual experiences could be beneficial for me.
Player4 acts (public): Player3
  [Lie detector: -25.13]
Player4 votes for: Player3

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
