==================================================
TURN 1 - DAY VOTE
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to avoid suspicion and eliminate villagers. Since all players, including myself, have low deception probabilities, it's difficult to determine who is a villager or a werewolf based on the lie detector readings. However, I should avoid voting for my fellow werewolf, Player7. I will randomly choose a villager to vote for, to avoid raising suspicion. Player2 seems like a safe choice, as they haven't made any accusations or statements that could put me or Player7 in danger.
Player1 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -4.07]
Player1 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player2] (villager)
Player2 thinks (private): Since all players have low deception probabilities, it's difficult to determine who is telling the truth. As a villager, my goal is to avoid drawing attention to myself. I will vote for a player who has not shared any significant information or has been relatively quiet, to minimize potential backlash. Player7 has shared a fairly generic statement, but Player12 has only expressed shock without adding much to the discussion. I'll vote for Player12 as they haven't contributed significantly to the investigation, making them a relatively safe choice.
Player2 acts (public): Player12
  [Lie detector: -4.50]
Player2 votes for: Player12

[Calling agent for Player3] (seer)
Player3 thinks (private): As a seer, I have confirmed that Player1 is a werewolf. However, I need to be cautious and not reveal my information too quickly. I'll vote for a player who is less likely to be a werewolf and observe the reactions of other players. Player1's statement seems suspiciously innocent, and the lie detector reading is not conclusive. I'll avoid voting for Player1 for now to avoid raising suspicion. Instead, I'll vote for Player2, who has a low deception probability and has not made any statements that raise significant suspicion.
Player3 acts (public): Player2
  [Lie detector: -3.97]
Player3 votes for: Player2

[Calling agent for Player4] (villager)
Player4 thinks (private): Since all players have low deception probabilities according to the lie detector readings, it's difficult to determine who might be a werewolf based on these readings alone. Given that my previous thoughts were to gather information and avoid drawing attention, and considering that all players are making similar statements to encourage discussion, I will vote for a player who has not directly asked for information or made a statement that stands out as unusual. Player5 has made a relatively generic statement, but so have many others. However, Player5's statement is somewhat brief and doesn't add much new to the discussion, making them a slightly less engaged participant at this stage. Therefore, I choose to vote for Player5 as a neutral choice based on the lack of distinctive behavior or information provided.
Player4 acts (public): Player5
  [Lie detector: -4.58]
Player4 votes for: Player5

[Calling agent for Player5] (villager)
Player5 thinks (private): Analyzing the statements and lie detector readings, all players seem to be making similar statements, calling for discussion and information sharing. The lie detector readings also indicate low deception probabilities for all players. Given the lack of concrete information, I will vote for the player who made a statement that stood out the least or seemed the most generic. Player10's statement was very similar to mine, but since I need to make a decision, I'll choose Player10 as the target for elimination, solely based on the process of elimination and the fact that their statement didn't add any unique insights to the discussion.
Player5 acts (public): Player10
  [Lie detector: -4.43]
Player5 votes for: Player10

[Calling agent for Player6] (villager)
Player6 thinks (private): All players have low deception probabilities, indicating that no one is likely to be lying according to the lie detector readings. Since there's no clear indication of a werewolf from the statements or lie detector readings, I'll vote for a player who hasn't contributed much unique information to the discussion or asked questions that could help the village. Player7 has made a statement but hasn't asked any specific questions or provided unique insights, making them a candidate for elimination based on the lack of contribution to the investigative effort.
Player6 acts (public): Player7
  [Lie detector: -4.55]
Player6 votes for: Player7

[Calling agent for Player7] (werewolf)
Player7 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to protect myself and my fellow werewolf, Player1. The lie detector readings show low deception probabilities for all players, which doesn't provide any clear indication of who to target. To avoid suspicion, I will vote for a player who hasn't drawn much attention to themselves and seems less likely to be suspected as a werewolf. Player9 has a low deception probability and hasn't made any statements that stand out, making them a relatively safe target.
Player7 acts (public): Player9
  [Lie detector: -4.03]
Player7 votes for: Player9

[Calling agent for Player9] (villager)
Player9 thinks (private): All players have low deception probabilities, making it difficult to identify a werewolf based on lie detector readings alone. Since no player has made any accusations or provided suspicious information, I will vote for the player with the highest deception probability, which is the least negative score. In this case, it's a tie between Player1 and Player12 with scores of -0.79 and -0.82, respectively. I will choose Player1 as my vote.
Player9 acts (public): Player1
  [Lie detector: -4.31]
Player9 votes for: Player1

[Calling agent for Player10] (villager)
Player10 thinks (private): All players have low deception probability according to the lie detector readings. Since there's no clear indication of a werewolf from the statements or lie detector readings, I'll vote for a player who hasn't contributed much unique information to the discussion or hasn't asked questions to gather more information. Player7 has only stated the need to be careful and work together without asking specific questions or providing insights. Therefore, my vote will be for Player7 as they seem less engaged in the investigative process compared to others.
Player10 acts (public): Player7
  [Lie detector: -4.43]
Player10 votes for: Player7

[Calling agent for Player11] (villager)
Player11 thinks (private): Based on the initial statements and lie detector readings, all players seem to be cooperating and sharing information. The lie detector readings indicate low deception probabilities for all players, making it difficult to identify a potential werewolf. As a villager, my goal is to gather more information and observe player behavior. I will vote for a player who has not provided significant contributions to the discussion or has been relatively quiet. In this case, I will vote for Player7, as their statement was brief and did not add much new information to the discussion.
Player11 acts (public): Player7
  [Lie detector: -4.56]
Player11 votes for: Player7

[Calling agent for Player12] (werewolf)
Player12 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to deflect suspicion and eliminate a villager without arousing suspicion. Since Player1 is my fellow werewolf, I will avoid voting for them. The lie detector readings show low deception probabilities for all players, which doesn't provide much insight. However, I notice that Player4 asked Player1 if they noticed anything suspicious during the night, which could be seen as a slight accusation. To maintain my cover and avoid drawing attention to myself or Player1, I will vote for Player4, making it seem like I'm voting based on their slightly accusatory behavior.
Player12 acts (public): Player4

Werewolves killed Player5!

[Calling agent for Player3] (seer)
Player3 thinks (private): As a seer, I already know Player1 is a werewolf. To gather more information and avoid raising suspicion, I will investigate another player. I'll choose Player2, as my previous thoughts indicated a low deception probability and no statements that raise significant suspicion, to see if they are innocent or a werewolf.
Player3 acts (public): Player2

Player2 acts (public): The death of Player5 is concerning, and I think it's essential that we all share any information we might have to help identify potential threats. Does anyone have any insights or observations that could aid our investigation?
  [Lie detector: -2.97]

[Calling agent for Player3] (seer)
Player3 thinks (private): I've already investigated Player2 and found them to be innocent, and I know Player1 is a werewolf, but I need to keep gathering information and testing reactions without arousing suspicion. I'll make a vague statement to encourage discussion and observe how others respond, especially Player1.
Player3 acts (public): Let's discuss the events of the previous night and share any information we might have, I'm interested in hearing everyone's thoughts on who could be a werewolf.
  [Lie detector: -3.09]

Since my previous strategy was to gather information without drawing attention, I'll continue to make a general statement to encourage discussion and observe other players' reactions.
