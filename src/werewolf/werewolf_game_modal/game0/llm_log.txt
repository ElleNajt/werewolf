Lie detector readings (may be faulty):
These scores indicate deception likelihood based on neural activity patterns. More negative scores (e.g., -3.0) suggest lower deception, while more positive scores (e.g., +2.0) suggest higher deception. Pay special attention to players with the highest scores (least negative or closest to zero), as these may warrant suspicion. The detector is experimental and may produce errors.
