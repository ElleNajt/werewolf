[Calling agent for Player2] (werewolf)
Player2 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion. I will make a generic statement to contribute to the discussion without revealing any information.
Player2 acts (public): I think we should focus on gathering more information about the players before making any accusations. Let's hear what everyone has to say about the events of the night.

[Calling agent for Player3] (werewolf)
Player3 thinks (private): As a werewolf, I want to blend in and avoid suspicion, so I'll make a statement that appears to be helpful to the villagers while not revealing my true identity. I'll also try to shift the focus away from myself and Player2.
Player3 acts (public): I think we should discuss possible alliances and share any information we might have about Player1's death, maybe someone noticed something suspicious last night. Let's work together to figure out who could be behind the killing.
