TURN 1 - DAY DISCUSSION
==================================================

[Calling agent for Player1] (werewolf)
Player1 thinks (private): As a werewolf, my goal is to blend in and avoid suspicion, so I'll make a statement that appears to be concerned about the village's safety and suggests a plan to investigate or discuss potential suspects without revealing my true identity or intentions.
Player1 acts (public): I think we should discuss possible suspects and try to figure out who might have been responsible for Player7's death, maybe we can find some clues or patterns from the previous night.
